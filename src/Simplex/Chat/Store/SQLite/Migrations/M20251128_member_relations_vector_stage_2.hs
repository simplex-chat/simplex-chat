-- TODO [relations vector] drop group_member_intros in the end of migration
-- Build member_relations_vector for all members that don't have it yet.
-- Vector byte encoding: 4 reserved | 1 direction | 3 status
-- Direction: 0 = IDSubjectIntroduced, 1 = IDReferencedIntroduced
-- Status values: 0 = MRNew, 1 = MRIntroduced, 2 = MRSubjectConnected, 3 = MRReferencedConnected, 4 = MRConnected
--
-- Query returns (idx, direction, intro_status) for each introduction:
-- - direction 0 (IDSubjectIntroduced): current member (subject) is re_group_member_id, was introduced to referenced member
-- - direction 1 (IDReferencedIntroduced): current member (subject) is to_group_member_id, referenced member was introduced to it
--
-- This migration uses custom aggregate function migrate_relations_vector(idx, direction, intro_status).
-- It is registered on DB open in Simplex.Messaging.Agent.Store.SQLite `connectDB`.
-- The aggregate transforms (direction, intro_status) into the final byte value:
-- - intro_status 'new'/'sent'/'rcv'/'fwd': MRIntroduced (1)
-- - intro_status 're-con': if direction=0 then MRSubjectConnected (2), else MRReferencedConnected (3)
-- - intro_status 'to-con': if direction=0 then MRReferencedConnected (3), else MRSubjectConnected (2)
-- - intro_status 'con': MRConnected (4)
