    "hero-overlay-card-2-p-3": "Even with the most private apps that use Tor v3 services, if you talk to two different contacts via the same profile they can prove that they are connected to the same person.",

    "simplex-network-overlay-card-1-li-1": "P2P networks rely on some variant of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table'>DHT</a> to route messages. DHT designs have to balance delivery guarantee and latency. SimpleX has both better delivery guarantee and lower latency than P2P, because the message can be redundantly passed via several servers in parallel, using the servers chosen by the recipient. In P2P networks the message is passed through <em>O(log N)</em> nodes sequentially, using nodes chosen by the algorithm.",
    "simplex-network-overlay-card-1-li-2": "SimpleX design, unlike most P2P networks, has no global user identifiers of any kind, even temporary, and only uses temporary pairwise identifiers, providing better anonymity and metadata protection.",
    "simplex-network-overlay-card-1-li-3": "P2P does not solve <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack'>MITM attack</a> problem, and most existing implementations do not use out-of-band messages for the initial key exchange. SimpleX uses out-of-band messages or, in some cases, pre-existing secure and trusted connections for the initial key exchange.",
    "simplex-network-overlay-card-1-li-4": "P2P implementations can be blocked by some Internet providers (like <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent'>BitTorrent</a>). SimpleX is transport agnostic - it can work over standard web protocols, e.g. WebSockets.",
    "simplex-network-overlay-card-1-li-5": "All known P2P networks may be vulnerable to <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack'>Sybil attack</a>, because each node is discoverable, and the network operates as a whole. Known measures to mitigate it require either a centralized component or expensive <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work'>proof of work</a>. SimpleX network has no server discoverability, it is fragmented and operates as multiple isolated sub-networks, making network-wide attacks impossible.",

SimpleX clients only relay traffic from known connection and cannot be used by an attacker to amplify the traffic in the whole network.",
    "privacy-matters-overlay-card-1-p-1": "Many large companies use information about who you are connected with to estimate your income, sell you the products you don't really need, and to determine the prices.",
    "privacy-matters-overlay-card-1-p-2": "Online retailers know that people with lower incomes are more likely to make urgent purchases, so they may charge higher prices or remove discounts.",
    "privacy-matters-overlay-card-1-p-3": "Some financial and insurance companies use social graphs to determine interest rates and premiums.

    "privacy-matters-overlay-card-2-p-2": "To be objective and to make independent decisions you need to be in control of your information space. It is only possible if you use private communication platform that does not have access to your social graph.",
    "privacy-matters-overlay-card-2-p-3": "SimpleX is the first platform that doesn't have any user identifiers by design, in this way protecting your connections graph better than any known alternative.",
    "privacy-matters-overlay-card-3-p-1": "Everyone should care about privacy and security of their communications &mdash; harmless conversations can put you in danger, even if you have nothing to hide.",
    "privacy-matters-overlay-card-3-p-2": "One of the most shocking stories is the experience of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamedou_Ould_Slahi' target='_blank'>Mohamedou Ould Salahi</a> described in his memoir and shown in The Mauritanian movie.

    "privacy-matters-overlay-card-3-p-4": "It is not enough to use an end-to-end encrypted messenger, we all should use the messengers that protect the privacy of our personal networks &mdash; who we are connected with.",
    "simplex-unique-overlay-card-1-p-1": "Unlike other messaging platforms, SimpleX has <strong>no identifiers assigned to the users</strong>. It does not rely on phone numbers, domain-based addresses (like email or XMPP), usernames, public keys or even random numbers to identify its users &mdash; we don&apos;t know how many people use our SimpleX servers.",
    "simplex-unique-overlay-card-1-p-2": "To deliver messages SimpleX uses <a href='https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/Pairwise_Pseudonymous_Identifier'>pairwise anonymous addresses</a> of unidirectional message queues, separate for received and sent messages, usually via different servers. Using SimpleX is like having <strong>a different &ldquo;burner&rdquo; email or phone for each contact</strong>, and no hassle to manage them.",
