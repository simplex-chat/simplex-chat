## The First Messenger Without User IDs

Unlike other messaging apps, SimpleX Chat has no user identifiers at all - not even random numbers. This protects both your messages and your metadata, hiding who you communicate with from servers and observers.

## Why It Matters

**Complete Privacy**: Other apps use phone numbers, usernames, or IDs. SimpleX uses none of these, making it impossible to build your social graph.

**No Spam**: You can't be contacted unless you share a one-time invitation link.

**Your Data**: Everything stays on your device. Servers only hold messages temporarily until delivered.

**True Decentralization**: Use your own servers or the provided ones - everyone can still communicate.

## Key Features

- 🔐 Double ratchet end-to-end encryption with post-quantum resistance
- 📱 Mobile apps for iOS and Android, desktop apps for all platforms
- 🎭 Incognito mode, disappearing messages, multiple profiles
- 🌐 Tor support and private message routing
- 💾 Encrypted local database and files
- 🚀 Open source with security audits by Trail of Bits

## How It Works

Connect by sharing a QR code or link. SimpleX uses disposable message queues instead of user addresses - like having a different phone number for each contact, automatically managed.
