# SimpleX Community Vouchers

We're developing Community Vouchers as a way to enable secure payments to server operators, to make communities sustainable.

Group or channel owners can select network operators for better reliability and censorship resistance than with traditional online publishing methods.

These vouchers are blockchain utility tokens &mdash; to focus purely on server capacity usage, like prepaid telephone cards.

## SMPX: Community Voucher Token planned for 2026

SMPX token is v1 of Community Vouchers. We are aiming to launch it in 2026.

<a href="javascript:showOrMintSimplexNft()" data-show-overlay="mint-simplex-nft" class="open-overlay-btn">Mint a free SimpleX NFT</a> for testnet access and feedback. The NFT is non-transferable, one per wallet.

**Preliminary token overview**
- full name: **SimpleX Community Voucher**.
- symbol: SMPX.
- network: Arbitrum One.
- standard: ERC20, with contract-enforced supply and other limits (TBD based on modeling and testing).

**Potential utilities**
- Server messaging and file capacity beyond free tier (see FAQ) for large channels and communities.
- Names in SimpleX Name System.

We're working with blockchain and legal experts for feasibility and compliance, aiming to launch testnet in 2026. Details may change based on input. More in our upcoming whitepaper draft.

## Community Vouchers FAQ

These are early insights into how Community Vouchers can work.

### Why Community Vouchers?

<img src="/img/design_3/community_vouchers_dark.jpg" width="30%" class="float-to-right hidden dark:block">

To cover server bills securely and privately.

With "free" centralized platforms:
- you lose security and privacy, because your data is used for advertising and sold.
- they de-platform inconvenient users, often based on frivolous complaints.
- you don't own all rights to your content.

Paying for server capacity is cheaper than "free" platforms. Our estimate based on the current costs is $5-10/month for 5,000 message receivers (could be up to 50,000 members) with 5-10 GB of files/media archive. These estimates are preliminary and may change.

### Free Tier?

Considering up to 1,000 message receivers and 500 MB storage for free groups.

### Why Not Existing Crypto?

For privacy without heavy compliance; limits emphasize utility over speculation.

### How Might Vouchers Work?

Buy via app (like phone top-ups), with automatic management.

V1 would use hashed IDs for privacy and on-chain payments. Zero-knowledge proofs and in-app payments to be added later.
