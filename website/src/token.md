**Published:** Oct 03, 2025

SimpleX is a privacy-focused messaging app that uses end-to-end encryption to ensure that your conversations remain private and secure. We believe that everyone has the right to communicate freely and securely, without fear of surveillance or censorship.

To support our mission of promoting privacy and secure communication, we are excited to announce the launch of our Community Voucher Program. This program is designed to help individuals and organizations that may not have the financial means to access secure messaging services.

Through the Community Voucher Program, we will be providing free access to SimpleX for individuals and organizations that meet certain criteria. This includes:
- Non-profit organizations that work to promote privacy and secure communication
- Activists and journalists who need secure communication tools to protect their sources and information
- Individuals who are at risk of surveillance or censorship due to their political beliefs or activities
To apply for a Community Voucher, simply fill out the application form on our website. We will review each application carefully and provide vouchers to those who meet our criteria.
We believe that everyone deserves access to secure communication tools, and we are committed to making SimpleX accessible to as many people as possible. If you know someone who could benefit from our Community Voucher Program, please share this information with them.
Thank you for your support in promoting privacy and secure communication!
