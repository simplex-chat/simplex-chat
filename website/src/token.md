# Community Vouchers: Your Freedom and Security

Community Vouchers will be used for secure and private payments to network server operators to make communities independent and financially sustainable.

The group or channel owners will decide which network operators to use, for better reliability and censorship resistance than with other ways to publish online content.

Based on blockchain zero-knowledge proofs, community vouchers are neither tokens nor cryptocurrency. They are network credits, similar to prepaid telephone cards, but on the blockchain, and their price will be based purely on server costs, not on speculative factors.

## SimpleX Token: Launching in 2026 ðŸš€

## Community Vouchers FAQ

### Why Community Vouchers?

Very simple - somebody has to pay the bills.

There are many social media and content platforms that are free to use. But they may turn out to be quite expensive:
- they collect and sell information about your online activity &mdash; to make you pay higher prices and to influence your opinions.
- you don't own the content you publish on "free" platforms. It limits your right to use this content, in case the audience grows and it becomes successful.
- the channel you created does not belong to you as well - it can be removed in case of copyright or other content complaints, even if they are not valid.

With centralized platforms you own nothing. The only solution to that is that groups and communities pay their own bills. The great news is that infrastructure for hosting is quite cheap, and we estimate that the cost to host a community of 5,000-10,000 users who receive messages (can be up to 100,000 members) with 5-10 Gb worth of files will be approximately $5-10 per month. This small amount will make communities independent and network operators profitable.

### Will there be free public groups and channels?

Yes, within a free tier limit.

We will confirm it in 2026, but approximately 1,000 users receiving messages (can be up to 5,000-10,000 members), and 500 Mb long-term storage capacity for files and media per group will be available for free.

Limit on sending files with 2 days in-transit storage will remain the same â€“ up to 1 Gb per file.

### Why not use existing tokens or cryptocurrencies?

We want to provide privacy and security of payments for the servers, which is incompatible with the necessary financial compliance in case of cryptocurrency or freely tradable token.

Community Vouchers are legally equivalent to prepaid telephone cards - community members and owners can buy them for fiat currency or cryptocurrency, and then use them to pay to network operators without identifying community owners - to protect their security and freedom of speech.

Community Vouchers will only allow 2 transfers between network users, to enable donations to communities, and will not be suitable as the long-term value storage, as they will expire in 6-12 months after purchase. These limitations will protect Community Vouchers from speculation and from financial regulations. Their price will be determined by the costs of providing the server capacity, and not speculatively, as it happens with cryptocurrencies.

### How will vouchers work for the users?

Users who want to pay for or sponsor their communities will buy Community Vouchers via the app and then the app will manage them automatically and transparently - no need to worry about managing wallets or cryptographic keys, it will be like topping up a prepaid mobile phone, including support for in-app payments.

The app will automatically choose another random operator to buy vouchers from, and the usage of vouchers will be unlinkable with the purchase - thanks to zero-knowledge proofs used with the vouchers.

### How will SimpleX network evolve to support Community Vouchers?

Currently there are two pre-configured operators in SimpleX apps, and you can use your own self-hosted servers. It allows for a high degree of network decentralization and for creation of protected network segments, unlike many networks where everybody has access to all servers, protecting SimpleX network from network-wide attacks. But for users that only use pre-configured servers the decentralization is limited.

The launch of Community Vouchers will create financial incentives for many other server operators to become available to the end users, under the same terms. SimpleX Chat Ltd and several non-profit entities in different jurisdictions (we already established SimpleX Chat Foundation in the US) will play the role of network regulator. They will sign the agreements with the network operators obliging them to honour the same privacy policy and quality of service as a condition of earning profit from SimpleX network traffic.

### How will vouchers work for the network operators?

To be able to issue the vouchers, the network operator will have to:
- sign the agreement with the network regulator,
- make a deposit to a smart contract, using either SimpleX utility tokens (see below) or any other supported cryptocurrency. This deposit will limit the amount of voucher credits the operator can issue without providing a service.
- share revenue from selling the vouchers with the network regulator. This share of revenue that the operator can retain will be higher for known operators, and lower for anonymous (as operator anonymity comes at a risk to users' privacy and security, so users will be able to opt out of using anonymous operators), and also 30% higher if deposit is made with SimpleX Utility Tokens and lower if it is made with some other cryptocurrency.

### What are the conditions of SimpleX NFT discount?

We offer the SimpleX NFT as a way to reward and to say "big thank you" to our early users and communities that made SimpleX network what it is today. It will also help us better understand the demand for SimpleX utility tokens.

SimpleX NFTs are completely free, you only need to pay Ethereum network fee to "mint" them (aka "gas", usually $0.5-1 per mint). You don't have to buy utility tokens if you decide not to, but if you do &mdash; SimpleX NFT will provide you an additional 20% discount.

Conditions:
- **20% discount** is applied to SimpleX utility token price after any other publicly available discounts.
- you can **buy utility tokens many times** - SimpleX NFT will remain in your wallet as a reminder of early days of SimpleX network.
- you can mint SimpleX NFT **only until midnight December 31, 2025** ([Anywhere on Earth time](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/aoe)).
- to receive this discount in 2026, you will have to buy SimpleX utility tokens via this website page to the wallet that has SimpleX NFT.
- you can **sell or gift SimpleX NFT** to any other wallet that does not have it.
- **only one SimpleX NFT per wallet**, except contract owner, where we can pre-mint NFTs. It is enforced by smart contract when minting and sending NFT, so if you already have a SimpleX NFT in the wallet you won't be able to mint or to buy another one.
- SimpleX NFT has **immutable conditions and image** on [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech) - we can't change them once minted.
- We reserve the right to stop minting NFTs or to change any conditions for future NFTs at any time.
