  <summary>Private and secure open-source messenger - no user IDs (not even random numbers)</summary>

  <description>
    <p>Security assessment was done by Trail of Bits in November 2022.</p>
    <p>SimpleX Chat features:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>end-to-end encrypted messages, with editing, replies and deletion of messages.</li>
      <li>sending end-to-end encrypted images and files.</li>
      <li>single-use and long-term user addresses.</li>
      <li>secret chat groups - only group members know it exists and who is the member.</li>
      <li>end-to-end encrypted audio and video calls.</li>
      <li>private instant notifications.</li>
      <li>portable chat profile - you can transfer your chat contacts and history to another device (terminal or mobile).</li>
      <li>encrypted app database and files in the app storage (except videos).</li>
      <li>18 interface languages.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>SimpleX Chat advantages:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Full privacy of your identity, profile, contacts and metadata</em>: unlike any other existing messaging platform, SimpleX uses no phone numbers or any other identifiers assigned to the users - not even random numbers. This protects the privacy of who you are communicating with, hiding it from SimpleX platform servers and from any observers.</li>
      <li><em>Complete protection against spam and abuse</em>: as you have no identifier on SimpleX platform, you cannot be contacted unless you share a one-time invitation link or an optional temporary user address.</li>
      <li><em>Full ownership, control and security of your data</em>: SimpleX stores all user data on client devices, the messages are only held temporarily on SimpleX relay servers until they are received.</li>
      <li><em>Decentralized network</em>: you can use SimpleX with your own servers and still communicate with people using the servers that are pre-configured in the apps or any other SimpleX servers.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can connect to anybody you know via link or scan QR code (in the video call or in person) and start sending messages instantly - no emails, phone numbers or passwords needed.</p> 
    <p>Your profile and contacts are only stored in the app on your device - our servers do not have access to this information.</p>
    <p>All messages are end-to-end encrypted using open-source double-ratchet protocol; the messages are routed via our servers using open-source SimpleX Messaging Protocol.</p>
    <p>Please send us any questions via the app or submit an issue on GitHub.</p>
    <p>Follow us on Mastodon, Twitter and Reddit for the latest updates.</p>
    <p>Once you install SimpleX Chat, "connect to developers" for any questions, to share feedback, and to discover the groups (the link for directory service will be in response).</p>
