## Quick start

To create SMP server, you'll need:

- VPS or any other server.
- Your server domain, with A and AAAA records specifying server IPv4 and IPv6 addresses (`smp1.example.com`)
- A basic Linux knowledge.

*Please note*: while you can run an SMP server without a domain name, in the near future client applications will start using server domain name in the invitation links (instead of `simplex.chat` domain they use now). In case a server does not have domain name and server pages (see below), the clients will be generaing the links with `simplex:` scheme that cannot be opened in the browsers.

1. Install server with [Installation script](https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplexmq#using-installation-script).

2. Adjust firewall:

   ```sh
   ufw allow 80/tcp &&\
   ufw allow 443/tcp &&\
   ufw allow 5223/tcp
   ```

3. Init server:

   Replace `smp1.example.com` with your actual server domain.

   ```sh
   su smp -c 'smp-server init --yes \
                           --store-log \
                           --no-password \
                           --control-port \
                           --socks-proxy \
                           --source-code \
                           --fqdn=smp1.example.com
   ```

4. Install tor:

   ```sh
   CODENAME="$(lsb_release -c | awk '{print $2}')"

   echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/tor-archive-keyring.gpg] https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org ${CODENAME} main
   deb-src [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/tor-archive-keyring.gpg] https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org ${CODENAME} main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/tor.list &&\
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org/A3C4F0F979CAA22CDBA8F512EE8CBC9E886DDD89.asc | gpg --dearmor | tee /usr/share/keyrings/tor-archive-keyring.gpg >/dev/null &&\
   apt update && apt install -y tor deb.torproject.org-keyring
   ```

5. Configure tor:

   ```sh
   tor-instance-create tor2 &&\
   mkdir /var/lib/tor/simplex-smp/ &&\
   chown debian-tor:debian-tor /var/lib/tor/simplex-smp/ &&\
   chmod 700 /var/lib/tor/simplex-smp/
   ```

   ```sh
   vim /etc/tor/torrc
   ```

   Paste the following:

   ```sh
   # Enable log (otherwise, tor doesn't seem to deploy onion address)
   Log notice file /var/log/tor/notices.log
   # Enable single hop routing (2 options below are dependencies of the third) - It will reduce the latency at the cost of lower anonimity of the server - as SMP-server onion address is used in the clients together with public address, this is ok. If you deploy SMP-server with onion-only address, keep standard configuration.
   SOCKSPort 0
   HiddenServiceNonAnonymousMode 1
   HiddenServiceSingleHopMode 1
   # smp-server hidden service host directory and port mappings
   HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/simplex-smp/
   HiddenServicePort 5223 localhost:5223
   HiddenServicePort 443 localhost:443
   ```

   ```sh
   vim /etc/tor/instances/tor2/torrc
   ```

   Paste the following:

   ```sh
   # Log tor to systemd daemon
   Log notice syslog
   # Listen to local 9050 port for socks proxy
   SocksPort 9050
   ```

6. Start tor:

   ```sh
   systemctl enable tor &&\
   systemctl start tor &&\
   systemctl restart tor &&\
   systemctl enable --now tor@tor2
   ```

7. Install Caddy:

   ```sh
   sudo apt install -y debian-keyring debian-archive-keyring apt-transport-https curl &&\
   curl -1sLf 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/caddy/stable/gpg.key' | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/caddy-stable-archive-keyring.gpg &&\
   curl -1sLf 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/caddy/stable/debian.deb.txt' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/caddy-stable.list &&\
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install caddy
   ```

8. Configure Caddy:

   ```sh
   vim /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
   ```

   Replace `smp1.example.com` with your actual server domain. Paste the following:

   ```
   http://smp1.example.com {
      redir https://smp1.example.com{uri} permanent
   }

   smp1.example.com:8443 {
      tls {
         key_type rsa4096
      }
   }
   ```

   ```sh
   vim /usr/local/bin/simplex-servers-certs
   ```

   Replace `smp1.example.com` with your actual server domain. Paste the following:

   ```sh
   #!/usr/bin/env sh
   set -eu

   user='smp'
   group="$user"

   domain='smp1.example.com'
   folder_in="/var/lib/caddy/.local/share/caddy/certificates/acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org-directory/${domain}"
   folder_out='/etc/opt/simplex'
   key_name='web.key'
   cert_name='web.crt'

   # Copy certifiacte from Caddy directory to smp-server directory
   cp "${folder_in}/${domain}.crt" "${folder_out}/${cert_name}"
   # Assign correct permissions
   chown "$user":"$group" "${folder_out}/${cert_name}"

   # Copy certifiacte key from Caddy directory to smp-server directory
   cp "${folder_in}/${domain}.key" "${folder_out}/${key_name}"
   # Assign correct permissions
   chown "$user":"$group" "${folder_out}/${key_name}"
   ```

   ```sh
   chmod +x /usr/local/bin/simplex-servers-certs
   ```

   ```sh
   sudo crontab -e
   ```

   Paste the following:

   ```sh
   # Every week on 00:20 sunday
   20 0 * * 0 /usr/local/bin/simplex-servers-certs
   ```

9. Enable and start Caddy service:

   Wait until "good to go" has been printed.

   ```sh
   systemctl enable --now caddy &&\
   sleep 10 &&\
   /usr/local/bin/simplex-servers-certs &&\
   echo 'good to go'
   ```

10. Enable and start smp-server:

    ```sh
    systemctl enable --now smp-server.service
    ```

11. Print your address:

    ```sh
    smp="$(journalctl --output cat -q _SYSTEMD_INVOCATION_ID="$(systemctl show -p InvocationID --value smp-server)" | grep -m1 'Server address:' | awk '{print $NF}' | sed 's/:443.*//')"
    tor="$(cat /var/lib/tor/simplex-smp/hostname)"

    echo "$smp,$tor"
    ```

## Detailed guide

### Overview

SMP server is the relay server used to pass messages in SimpleX network. SimpleX Chat apps have preset servers (for mobile apps these are smp11, smp12 and smp14.simplex.im), but you can easily change app configuration to use other servers.

SimpleX clients only determine which server is used to receive the messages, separately for each contact (or group connection with a group member), and these servers are only temporary, as the delivery address can change.

To create SMP server, you'll need:

1. VPS or any other server.
2. Your own domain, pointed at the server (`smp.example.com`)
3. A basic Linux knowledge.

_Please note_: when you change the servers in the app configuration, it only affects which servers will be used for the new contacts, the existing contacts will not automatically move to the new servers, but you can move them manually using ["Change receiving address"](../blog/20221108-simplex-chat-v4.2-security-audit-new-website.md#change-your-delivery-address-beta) button in contact/member information pages – it will be automated in the future.

### Installation

1. First, install `smp-server`:

   - Manual deployment (see below)

   - Semi-automatic deployment:
     - [Installation script](https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplexmq#using-installation-script)
     - [Docker container](https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplexmq#using-docker)
     - [Linode Marketplace](https://www.linode.com/marketplace/apps/simplex-chat/simplex-chat/)

Manual installation requires some preliminary actions:

1. Install binary:

   - Using pre-compiled binaries:

     ```sh
     curl -L https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplexmq/releases/latest/download/smp-server-ubuntu-20_04-x86-64 -o /usr/local/bin/smp-server && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/smp-server
     ```

   - Compiling from source:

     Please refer to [Build from source: Using your distribution](https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplexmq#using-your-distribution)

2. Create user and group for `smp-server`:

   ```sh
   sudo useradd -m smp
   ```

3. Create necessary directories and assign permissions:

   ```sh
   sudo mkdir -p /var/opt/simplex /etc/opt/simplex
   sudo chown smp:smp /var/opt/simplex /etc/opt/simplex
   ```

4. Allow `smp-server` port in firewall:

   ```sh
   # For Ubuntu
   sudo ufw allow 5223/tcp
   sudo ufw allow 443/tcp
   sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
   # For Fedora
   sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=5223/tcp --add-port=443/tcp --add-port=80/tcp && \
   sudo firewall-cmd --reload
   ```

5. **Optional** — If you're using distribution with `systemd`, create `/etc/systemd/system/smp-server.service` file with the following content:

   ```sh
   [Unit]
   Description=SMP server systemd service

   [Service]
   User=smp
   Group=smp
   Type=simple
   ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/smp-server start +RTS -N -RTS
   ExecStopPost=/usr/bin/env sh -c '[ -e "/var/opt/simplex/smp-server-store.log" ] && cp "/var/opt/simplex/smp-server-store.log" "/var/opt/simplex/smp-server-store.log.bak"'
   LimitNOFILE=65535
   KillSignal=SIGINT
   TimeoutStopSec=infinity
   AmbientCapabilities=CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

   And execute `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`.

### Configuration

To see which options are available, execute `smp-server` without flags:

```sh
sudo su smp -c smp-server

...
Available commands:
  init                     Initialize server - creates /etc/opt/simplex and
                           /var/opt/simplex directories and configuration files
  start                    Start server (configuration:
                           /etc/opt/simplex/smp-server.ini)
  delete                   Delete configuration and log files
```

You can get further help by executing `sudo su smp -c "smp-server <command> -h"`

After that, we need to configure `smp-server`:

#### Interactively

Execute the following command:

```sh
sudo su smp -c "smp-server init"
```

There are several options to consider:

- `Enable store log to restore queues and messages on server restart (Yn):`

  Enter `y` to enable saving and restoring connections and messages when the server is restarted.

  _Please note_: it is important to use SIGINT to restart the server, as otherwise the undelivered messages will not be restored. The connections will be restored irrespective of how the server is restarted, as unlike messages they are added to append-only log on every change.

- `Enable logging daily statistics (yN):`

  Enter `y` to enable logging statistics in CSV format, e.g. they can be used to show aggregate usage charts in `Grafana`.

These statistics include daily counts of created, secured and deleted queues, sent and received messages, and also daily, weekly, and monthly counts of active queues (that is, the queues that were used for any messages). We believe that this information does not include anything that would allow correlating different queues as belonging to the same users, but please [let us know](./SECURITY.md), confidentially, if you believe that this can be exploited in any way.

- `Require a password to create new messaging queues?`

  Press `Enter` or enter your arbitrary password to password-protect `smp-server`, or `n` to disable password protection.

- `Enter server FQDN or IP address for certificate (127.0.0.1):`

  Enter your domain or ip address that your smp-server is running on - it will be included in server certificates and also printed as part of server address.

#### Via command line options

Execute the following command:

```sh
sudo su smp -c "smp-server init -h"

...
Available options:
  -l,--store-log           Enable store log for persistence
  -s,--daily-stats         Enable logging daily server statistics
  -a,--sign-algorithm ALG  Signature algorithm used for TLS certificates:
                           ED25519, ED448 (default: ED448)
  --ip IP                  Server IP address, used as Common Name for TLS online
                           certificate if FQDN is not supplied
                           (default: "127.0.0.1")
  -n,--fqdn FQDN           Server FQDN used as Common Name for TLS online
                           certificate
  --no-password            Allow creating new queues without password
  --password PASSWORD      Set password to create new messaging queues
  -y,--yes                 Non-interactive initialization using command-line
                           options
  -h,--help                Show this help text
```

You should determine which flags are needed for your use-case and then execute `smp-server init` with `-y` flag for non-interactive initialization:

```sh
sudo su smp -c "smp-server init -y -<your flag> <your option>"
```

For example, run:

```sh
sudo su smp -c "smp-server init -y -l --ip 192.168.1.5 --password test"
```

to initialize your `smp-server` configuration with:

- restoring connections and messages when the server is restarted (`-l` flag),
- IP address `192.168.1.5`,
- protect `smp-server` with a password `test`.

---

After that, your installation is complete and you should see in your teminal output something like this:

```sh
Certificate request self-signature ok
subject=CN = 127.0.0.1
Server initialized, you can modify configuration in /etc/opt/simplex/smp-server.ini.
Run `smp-server start` to start server.
----------
You should store CA private key securely and delete it from the server.
If server TLS credential is compromised this key can be used to sign a new one, keeping the same server identity and established connections.
CA private key location: /etc/opt/simplex/ca.key
----------
SMP server v3.4.0
Fingerprint: d5fcsc7hhtPpexYUbI2XPxDbyU2d3WsVmROimcL90ss=
Server address: smp://d5fcsc7hhtPpexYUbI2XPxDbyU2d3WsVmROimcL90ss=:V8ONoJ6ICwnrZnTC_QuSHfCEYq53uLaJKQ_oIC6-ve8=@<hostnames>
```

The server address above should be used in your client configuration, and if you added server password it should only be shared with the other people who you want to allow using your server to receive the messages (all your contacts will be able to send messages - it does not require a password). If you passed IP address or hostnames during the initialisation, they will be printed as part of server address, otherwise replace `<hostnames>` with the actual server hostnames.

### Further configuration

All generated configuration, along with a description for each parameter, is available inside configuration file in `/etc/opt/simplex/smp-server.ini` for further customization. Depending on the smp-server version, the configuration file looks something like this:

```ini

### Server security

#### Initialization

Although it's convenient to initialize smp-server configuration directly on the server, operators **ARE ADVISED** to initialize smp-server fully offline to protect your SMP server CA private key.

Follow the steps to quickly initialize the server offline:

1. Install Docker on your system.

2. Deploy [smp-server](https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplexmq#using-docker) locally.

3. Destroy the container. All relevant configuration files and keys will be available at `$HOME/simplex/smp/config`.

4. Move your `CA` private key (`ca.key`) to the safe place. For further explanation, see the next section: [Server security: Private keys](#private-keys).

5. Copy all other configuration files **except** the CA key to the server:

   ```sh
   rsync -hzasP $HOME/simplex/smp/config/ <server_user>@<server_address>:/etc/opt/simplex/
   ```

#### Private keys

Connection to the smp server occurs via a TLS connection. During the TLS handshake, the client verifies smp-server CA and server certificates by comparing its fingerprint with the one included in server address. If server TLS credential is compromised, this key can be used to sign a new one, keeping the same server identity and established connections. In order to protect your smp-server from bad actors, operators **ARE ADVISED** to move CA private key to a safe place. That could be:

- [Tails](https://tails.net/) live usb drive with [persistent and encrypted storage](https://tails.net/doc/persistent_storage/create/index.en.html).
- Offline Linux laptop.
- Bitwarden.
- Any other safe storage that satisfy your security requirements.

Follow the steps to secure your CA keys:

1. Login to your server via SSH.

2. Copy the CA key to a safe place from this file:

   ```sh
   /etc/opt/simplex/ca.key
   ```

3. Delete the CA key from the server. **Please make sure you've saved you CA key somewhere safe. Otherwise, you would lose the ability to [rotate the online certificate](#online-certificate-rotation)**:

   ```sh
   rm /etc/opt/simplex/ca.key
   ```

#### Online certificate rotation

Operators of smp servers **ARE ADVISED** to rotate online certificate regularly (e.g., every 3 months). In order to do this, follow the steps:

1. Create relevant folders:

   ```sh
   mkdir -p $HOME/simplex/smp/config
   ```

1. Copy the configuration files from the server to the local machine (if not yet):

   ```sh
   rsync -hzasP <server_user>@<server_address>:/etc/opt/simplex/ $HOME/simplex/smp/config/
   ```

2. **Copy** your CA private key from a safe place to the local machine and name it `ca.key`.

3. Download latest `smp-server` binary [from Github releases](https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplexmq/releases):

   ```sh
   curl -L 'https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplexmq/releases/latest/download/smp-server-ubuntu-20_04-x86-64' -o smp-server
   ```

4. Put the `smp-server` binary to your `$PATH` and make it executable:

   ```sh
   sudo mv smp-server /usr/local/bin/ && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/smp-server
   ```

5. Export a variable to configure your path to smp-server configuration:

   ```sh
   export SMP_SERVER_CFG_PATH=$HOME/simplex/smp/config
   ```

6. Execute the following command:

   ```sh
   smp-server cert
   ```

   This command should print:

   ```sh
   Certificate request self-signature ok
   subject=CN = <your domain or IP>
   Generated new server credentials
   ----------
   You should store CA private key securely and delete it from the server.
   If server TLS credential is compromised this key can be used to sign a new one, keeping the same server identity and established connections.
   CA private key location:
   $HOME/simplex/smp/config/ca.key
   ----------
   ```

7. Remove the CA key from the config folder (make sure you have a backup!):

   ```sh
   rm $HOME/simplex/smp/config/ca.key
   ```

8. Upload new certificates to the server:

   ```sh
   rsync -hzasP $HOME/simplex/smp/config/ <server_user>@<server_address>:/etc/opt/simplex/
   ```

9. Connect to the server via SSH and restart the service:

   ```sh
   ssh <server_user>@<server_address> "systemctl restart smp-server"
   ```

10. Done!

### Tor: installation and configuration

#### Installation for onion address

SMP-server can also be deployed to be available via [Tor](https://www.torproject.org) network. Run the following commands as `root` user.

1. Install tor:

   We're assuming you're using Ubuntu/Debian based distributions. If not, please refer to [offical tor documentation](https://community.torproject.org/onion-services/setup/install/) or your distribution guide.

   - Configure offical Tor PPA repository:

     ```sh
     CODENAME="$(lsb_release -c | awk '{print $2}')"
     echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/tor-archive-keyring.gpg] https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org ${CODENAME} main
     deb-src [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/tor-archive-keyring.gpg] https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org ${CODENAME} main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/tor.list
     ```

   - Import repository key:

     ```sh
     curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org/A3C4F0F979CAA22CDBA8F512EE8CBC9E886DDD89.asc | gpg --dearmor | tee /usr/share/keyrings/tor-archive-keyring.gpg >/dev/null
     ```

   - Update repository index:

     ```sh
     apt update
     ```

   - Install `tor` package:

     ```sh
     apt install -y tor deb.torproject.org-keyring
     ```

2. Configure tor:

   - File configuration:
  
     Open tor configuration with your editor of choice (`nano`,`vim`,`emacs`,etc.):

     ```sh
     vim /etc/tor/torrc
     ```

     And insert the following lines to the bottom of configuration. Please note lines starting with `#`: this is comments about each individual options.

     ```sh
     # Enable log (otherwise, tor doesn't seem to deploy onion address)
     Log notice file /var/log/tor/notices.log
     # Enable single hop routing (2 options below are dependencies of the third) - It will reduce the latency at the cost of lower anonimity of the server - as SMP-server onion address is used in the clients together with public address, this is ok. If you deploy SMP-server with onion-only address, you may want to keep standard configuration instead.
     SOCKSPort 0
     HiddenServiceNonAnonymousMode 1
     HiddenServiceSingleHopMode 1
     # smp-server hidden service host directory and port mappings
     HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/simplex-smp/
     HiddenServicePort 5223 localhost:5223
     HiddenServicePort 443 localhost:443
     ```

   - Create directories:

     ```sh
     mkdir /var/lib/tor/simplex-smp/ && chown debian-tor:debian-tor /var/lib/tor/simplex-smp/ && chmod 700 /var/lib/tor/simplex-smp/
     ```

3. Start tor:

   Enable `systemd` service and start tor. Offical `tor` is a bit flaky on the first start and may not create onion host address, so we're restarting it just in case.

   ```sh
   systemctl enable --now tor && systemctl restart tor
   ```

4. Display onion host:

   Execute the following command to display your onion host address:

   ```sh
   cat /var/lib/tor/simplex-smp/hostname
   ```

#### SOCKS port for SMP PROXY

SMP-server versions starting from `v5.8.0-beta.0` can be configured to PROXY smp servers available exclusively through [Tor](https://www.torproject.org) network to be accessible to the clients that do not use Tor. Run the following commands as `root` user.

1. Install tor as described in the [previous section](#installation-for-onion-address).

2. Execute the following command to creatae a new Tor daemon instance:

   ```sh
   tor-instance-create tor2
   ```

3. Open the `tor2` configuration and replace its content with the following lines:

   ```sh
   vim /etc/tor/instances/tor2/torrc
   ```

   ```sh
   # Log tor to systemd daemon
   Log notice syslog
   # Listen to local 9050 port for socks proxy
   SocksPort 9050
   ```

3. Enable service at startup and start the daemon:

   ```sh
   systemctl enable --now tor@tor2
   ```

   You can check `tor2` logs with the following command:

   ```sh
   journalctl -u tor@tor2
   ```

4. After [server initialization](#configuration), configure the `PROXY` section like so:

   ```ini
   ...
   [PROXY]
   socks_proxy: 127.0.0.1:9050
   own_server_domains: <your domain suffixes if using `log_stats: on`>
   ...
   ```

### Server information page

SMP server **SHOULD** be configured to serve Web page with server information that can include admin info, server info, provider info, etc. It will also serve connection links, generated using the mobile/desktop apps. Run the following commands as `root` user.

_Please note:_ this configuration is supported since `v6.1.0-beta.2`.

1. Add the following to your smp-server configuration (please modify fields in [INFORMATION] section to include relevant information):

   ```sh
   vim /etc/opt/simplex/smp-server.ini
   ```

   ```ini
   [TRANSPORT]
   # host is only used to print server address on start
   host: <domain/ip>
   port: 443,5223
   websockets: off
   log_tls_errors: off
   control_port: 5224

   [WEB]
   https: 443
   static_path: /var/opt/simplex/www
   cert: /etc/opt/simplex/web.crt
   key: /etc/opt/simplex/web.key

   ```

2. Install the webserver. For easy deployment we'll describe the installtion process of [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com) webserver on Ubuntu server:

   1. Install the packages:

      ```sh
      sudo apt install -y debian-keyring debian-archive-keyring apt-transport-https curl
      ```

   2. Install caddy gpg key for repository:

      ```sh
      curl -1sLf 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/caddy/stable/gpg.key' | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/caddy-stable-archive-keyring.gpg
      ```

   3. Install Caddy repository:

      ```sh
      curl -1sLf 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/caddy/stable/debian.deb.txt' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/caddy-stable.list
      ```

   4. Install Caddy:

      ```sh
      sudo apt update && sudo apt install caddy
      ```

   [Full Caddy instllation instructions](https://caddyserver.com/docs/install)

3. Replace Caddy configuration with the following:

   Please replace `YOUR_DOMAIN` with your actual domain (smp.example.com).

   ```sh
   vim /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
   ```

   ```
   http://YOUR_DOMAIN {
      redir https://YOUR_DOMAIN{uri} permanent
   }

   YOUR_DOMAIN:8443 {
      tls {
         key_type rsa4096
      }
   }
   ```

4. Enable and start Caddy service:

   ```sh
   systemctl enable --now caddy
   ```

5. Create script to copy certificates to your smp directory:

   Please replace `YOUR_DOMAIN` with your actual domain (smp.example.com).

   ```sh
   vim /usr/local/bin/simplex-servers-certs
   ```

   ```sh
   #!/usr/bin/env sh
   set -eu

   user='smp'
   group="$user"

   domain='HOST'
   folder_in="/var/lib/caddy/.local/share/caddy/certificates/acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org-directory/${domain}"
   folder_out='/etc/opt/simplex'
   key_name='web.key'
   cert_name='web.crt'

   # Copy certifiacte from Caddy directory to smp-server directory
   cp "${folder_in}/${domain}.crt" "${folder_out}/${cert_name}"
   # Assign correct permissions
   chown "$user":"$group" "${folder_out}/${cert_name}"

   # Copy certifiacte key from Caddy directory to smp-server directory
   cp "${folder_in}/${domain}.key" "${folder_out}/${key_name}"
   # Assign correct permissions
   chown "$user":"$group" "${folder_out}/${key_name}"
   ```

6. Make the script executable and execute it:

   ```sh
   chmod +x /usr/local/bin/simplex-servers-certs && /usr/local/bin/simplex-servers-certs
   ```

7. Check if certificates were copied:

   ```sh
   ls -haltr /etc/opt/simplex/web*
   ```

8. Create cronjob to copy certificates to smp directory in timely manner:

   ```sh
   sudo crontab -e
   ```

   ```sh
   # Every week on 00:20 sunday
   20 0 * * 0 /usr/local/bin/simplex-servers-certs
   ```

9. Then:

   - If you're running at least `v6.1.0-beta.2`, [restart the server](#systemd-commands).
   - If you're running below `v6.1.0-beta.2`, [upgrade the server](#updating-your-smp-server).

10. Access the webpage you've deployed from your browser (`https://smp.example.org`). You should see the smp-server information that you've provided in your ini file.

To import `csv` to `Grafana` one should:

1. Install Grafana plugin: [Grafana - CSV datasource](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/marcusolsson-csv-datasource/)

2. Allow local mode by appending following:

   ```sh
   [plugin.marcusolsson-csv-datasource]
   allow_local_mode = true
   ```

   ... to `/etc/grafana/grafana.ini`

3. Add a CSV data source:

   - In the side menu, click the Configuration tab (cog icon)
   - Click Add data source in the top-right corner of the Data Sources tab
   - Enter "CSV" in the search box to find the CSV data source
   - Click the search result that says "CSV"
   - In URL, enter a file that points to CSV content

4. You're done! You should be able to create your own dashboard with statistics.

### Configuring the app to use the server

To configure the app to use your messaging server copy it's full address, including password, and add it to the app. You have an option to use your server together with preset servers or without them - you can remove or disable them.

It is also possible to share the address of your server with your friends by letting them scan QR code from server settings - it will include server password, so they will be able to receive messages via your server as well.

_Please note_: you need SMP server version 4.0 to have password support. If you already have a deployed server, you can add password by adding it to server INI file.
