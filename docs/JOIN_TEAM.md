# Join SimpleX Chat team

SimpleX Chat Ltd is a seed stage startup with a lot of user growth in 2022-2023, and a lot of exciting technical and product problems to solve to grow faster.

We currently have 4 full-time people in the team - all engineers, including the founder.

We want to add up to 3 people to the team. 


## Who we are looking for

### Product/UI designer

You will be designing the user experience and the interface of both the app and the website in collaboration with the team.

The current focus of the app is privacy and security, but we hope to have the design that would support the feeling of psychological safety, enabling people to achieve the results in the smallest amount of time.

You are an experienced and innovative product designer with:
- 8+ years of user experience and visual design.
- Expertise in typography and high sensitivity to colors.
- Exceptional precision and attention to details.
- Strong opinions (weakly held).
- A strong empathy.

### Application Haskell engineer

You will work with the Haskell core of the client applications and with the network servers.

You are an expert in language models, databases and Haskell:
- expert knowledge of SQL.
- Haskell exception handling, concurrency, STM, type systems.
- 8y+ of software engineering experience in complex projects, 
- deep understanding of the common programming principles:
  - data structures, bits and bytes, text encoding.
  - software design and algorithms.
  - concurrency.
  - networking.

## About you

- **Passionate about joining SimpleX Chat team**:
  - already use SimpleX Chat to communicate with friends/family or participate in public SimpleX Chat groups.
  - passionate about privacy, security and communications.
  - interested to make contributions to SimpleX Chat open-source project in your free time before we hire you, as an extended test.

- **Exceptionally pragmatic, very fast and customer-focussed**:
  - care about the customers (aka users) and about the product we build much more than about the code quality, technology stack, etc.
  - believe that the simplest solution is the best.
  - 2-3x faster than the most competent people you worked with.
  - focus on solving only today's problems and resist engineering for the future (aka over-engineering) – see [The Duct Tape Programmer](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2009/09/23/the-duct-tape-programmer/) and [Why I Hate Frameworks](https://medium.com/@johnfliu/why-i-hate-frameworks-6af8cbadba42).
  - do not suffer from "not invented here" syndrome, at the same time interested to design and implement protocols and systems from the ground up when appropriate.

- **Want to join a very early stage startup**:
  - high pace and intensity, longer hours.
  - a substantial part of the compensation is stock options.
  - full transparency - we believe that too much [autonomy](https://twitter.com/KentBeck/status/851459129830850561) hurts learning and slows down progress.
