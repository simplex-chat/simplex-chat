# Join SimpleX Chat team

SimpleX Chat is a seed stage startup with a lot of user growth in 2022-2025, and a lot of exciting technical and product problems to solve to grow faster.

We currently have 4 people in the team.

We are looking for passionate and creative people to help us!

## Who we are looking for

### Mobile application developer

You:
- created mobile applications for Android platforms as **your own full-time or side projects**,
- expertise with Android APIs, Kotlin and JetPack Compose framework,
- [a good taste](https://paulgraham.com/taste.html) for mobile apps design would be a bonus.

It is not a full time job yet, we have some specific problems to solve in the Android app. If we are happy working together it is likely to evolve into a full-time job offer in 2026.

Please ONLY apply if you created and released your own apps (not as a job or contract for somebody else).

## How to join the team

1. [Install the app](https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplex-chat#install-the-app), try using it with the friends and [join some user groups](https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplex-chat#join-user-groups) â€“ you will discover a lot of things that need improvements.

2. Also look through [GitHub issues](https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplex-chat/issues) submitted by the users to see what would you want to contribute as a test.

3. [Connect to us](https://smp4.simplex.im/a#IWCurmcnKDvfOzGrQdqlXjKinqkvO10a2q__nWBVG6c) via SimpleX Chat to chat about what you want to contribute and about joining the team.
