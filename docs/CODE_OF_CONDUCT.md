# Code of Conduct

We’re building great software through **engineering excellence**, **prioritizing users’ needs**, and **collaboration based on merit and respect**.

Everyone is welcome to contribute by following these guidelines:

**Contribution Acceptance**: We evaluate contributions iteratively based on quality, user needs, and project goals. Discuss plans early to align efforts, as acceptance depends on refinement guided by maintainers’ feedback.

**Equal Treatment**: All contributors are valued equally, regardless of background or beliefs. Discrimination or policies favoring specific groups are not allowed.

**Constructive Criticism**: Share clear, evidence-based and respectful criticism to improve the project.

**Focus on Work**: Avoid fear, uncertainty, doubt (FUD), or personal attacks.

**Relevant Discussions**: Stick to software and project goals, avoiding politics, ideology, or unrelated topics.

Violations may lead to warnings, temporary bans, or removal, at maintainers’ discretion.

Let’s create great software together!
