# Connect to somebody in the chat

_Work in progress_

Because you have no identifier on the SimpleX platform, nobody can contact you unless you share a one-time or temporary user address, such as a QR code or a link.

Even with the optional user address, while it can be used to send spam contact requests, you can change or completely delete it without losing any of your connections.

Private Connection — connect using an invitation link or QR code via video or in-person.

Group Chat — Users have the option to create a secret group, share their contact link [which can be deleted later on], or generate a one-time invitation link.

## Conversation preferences

Tap on one of your conversations to open conversation preferences.
Here you can choose whether you wish to allow disappearing messages, deleting messages for everyone and voice messages.
