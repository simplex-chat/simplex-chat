After installing SimpleX Chat:

After creating your first chat profile, the app will then ask you to create a SimpleX address. You can skip this step if you don't want to by tapping **Don't create address**. You can always create it later.

#### To create your SimpleX address:

1. Click or tap **Create SimpleX address**.
2. (Optional) Click or tap **Share** to share your SimpleX address with your contacts.
3. (Optional) Click or tap **Invite friends** to send an email invitation to your friends who don't have SimpleX Chat.
4. Click or tap **Continue**.

For more details on what a SimpleX address is, how you can set it up, and what it can be used for, please visit the [Managing Connections page](#simplex-address).

### Choose notifications mode

After you have created your first chat profile and/or SimpleX address, the app will ask you to choose how you want to receive notifications. Please read the description for each option. On iOS, it is trade-off between convenience and privacy, with instant notifications sharing more meta-data with the servers. On Android, it is a trade-off between notification delays and battery life. Once you've made your choice, tap **Use chat**.

For more details about how notifications work on Android versus iOS, please read [this blog post](../../blog/20220404-simplex-chat-instant-notifications.md).

### Connect with friends

You can start telling your friends to download SimpleX Chat [here](https://simplex.chat/downloads/). While they're at it, create a one-time invitation for each one of them and share it either as a QR code in person or as a link from a distance. These will appear as pending connections in the main **Chats** screen after they've been created. You can optionally set a contact name for each invitation to help remember who it's for.

#### Here's how to do it:

1. On Android or desktop, tap on the 🖉 (floating pencil) button in the bottom-right corner of the **Chats** screen. On iOS, tap on the 🖉 (pencil) button in the top-right corner of the **Chats** screen.
2. Tap or click **Add contact**.
3. Tap or click **Share this 1-time link** to share it with your friend from a distance. Or, you can show your QR code in person for your friend to scan.
4. (Optional) Toggle **Incognito** on to share a random profile with your friend.
5. (Optional) Return to the **Chats** screen and then tap or click on an invitation to set a contact name.

**Tip**: you can also [create a SimpleX address](./making-connections.md#to-create-and-share-a-simplex-address) to manage your connections.

### Join some groups

There are links to join several [SimpleX user groups](../../README.md#join-user-groups) available on our GitHub page - join them to ask any questions and discuss ideas. You can also connect to our [directory service](https://simplex.chat/contact/#/?v=1-4&smp=smp%3A%2F%2Fu2dS9sG8nMNURyZwqASV4yROM28Er0luVTx5X1CsMrU%3D%40smp4.simplex.im%2FeXSPwqTkKyDO3px4fLf1wx3MvPdjdLW3%23%2F%3Fv%3D1-2%26dh%3DMCowBQYDK2VuAyEAaiv6MkMH44L2TcYrt_CsX3ZvM11WgbMEUn0hkIKTOho%253D%26srv%3Do5vmywmrnaxalvz6wi3zicyftgio6psuvyniis6gco6bp6ekl4cqj4id.onion) and search for more user-managed groups to join there.

   - Click or tap on the QR code symbol in the right-hand side of the search bar on the **Chats** screen. Scan QR code or paste group link to join.
