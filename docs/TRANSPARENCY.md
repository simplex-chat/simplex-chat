# Transparency Reports

**Updated**: Oct 14, 2024

SimpleX Chat Ltd. is a company registered in the UK â€“ it develops communication software enabling users to operate and communicate via SimpleX network, without user profile identifiers of any kind, and without having their data hosted by any network infrastructure operators.

This page will include any and all reports on requests for user data.

*To date, we received none*.

Our objective is to consistently ensure that no user data and absolute minimum of the metadata required for the network to function is available for disclosure by any infrastructure operators, under any circumstances.
