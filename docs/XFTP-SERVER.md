# Hosting your own XFTP Server

## Overview

XFTP is a new file transfer protocol focussed on meta-data protection - it is based on the same principles as SimpleX Messaging Protocol used in SimpleX Chat messenger:

   - asynchronous file delivery - the sender does not need to be online for file to be received, it is stored on XFTP relays for a limited time (currently, it is 48 hours) or until deleted by the sender.
   - padded e2e encryption of file content.
   - content padding and fixed size chunks sent via different XFTP relays, assembled back into the original file by the receiving client.
   - efficient sending to multiple recipients (the file needs to be uploaded only once).
   - no identifiers or ciphertext in common between sent and received relay traffic, same as for messages delivered by SMP relays.
   - protection of sender IP address from the recipients.

## Installation

0. First, install `xftp-server`:

   - Manual deployment (see below)

   - Semi-automatic deployment:
     - [Offical installation script](https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplexmq#using-installation-script)
     - [Docker container](https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplexmq#using-docker)
     - [Linode Marketplace](https://www.linode.com/marketplace/apps/simplex-chat/simplex-chat/)

Manual installation requires some preliminary actions:

0. Install binary:

   - Using offical binaries:

     ```sh
     curl -L https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplexmq/releases/latest/download/xftp-server-ubuntu-20_04-x86-64 -o /usr/local/bin/xftp-server && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/xftp-server
     ```

   - Compiling from source:

     Please refer to [Build from source: Using your distribution](https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplexmq#using-your-distribution)


1. Create user and group for `xftp-server`:

   ```sh
   sudo useradd -m xftp
   ```

2. Create necessary directories and assign permissions:

   ```sh
   sudo mkdir -p /var/opt/simplex-xftp /etc/opt/simplex-xftp /srv/xftp
   sudo chown xftp:xftp /var/opt/simplex-xftp /etc/opt/simplex-xftp /srv/xftp
   ```

3. Allow xftp-server port in firewall:

   ```sh
   # For Ubuntu
   sudo ufw allow 443/tcp
   # For Fedora
   sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=443/tcp && \
   sudo firewall-cmd --reload
   ```

4. **Optional** — If you're using distribution with `systemd`, create `/etc/systemd/system/xftp-server.service` file with the following content:

   ```sh
   [Unit]
   Description=XFTP server systemd service
  
   [Service]
   User=xftp
   Group=xftp
   Type=simple
   ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/xftp-server start +RTS -N -RTS
   ExecStopPost=/usr/bin/env sh -c '[ -e "/var/opt/simplex-xftp/file-server-store.log" ] && cp "/var/opt/simplex-xftp/file-server-store.log" "/var/opt/simplex-xftp/file-server-store.log.$(date +'%%FT%%T')"'
   LimitNOFILE=65535
   KillSignal=SIGINT
   TimeoutStopSec=infinity
   AmbientCapabilities=CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE
      
   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

   And execute `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`.

## Tor installation

xftp-server can also be deployed to serve from [tor](https://www.torproject.org) network. Run the following commands as `root` user.

1. Install tor:

   We're assuming you're using Ubuntu/Debian based distributions. If not, please refer to [offical tor documentation](https://community.torproject.org/onion-services/setup/install/) or your distribution guide.

   - Configure offical Tor PPA repository:

     ```sh
     CODENAME="$(lsb_release -c | awk '{print $2}')"
     echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/tor-archive-keyring.gpg] https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org ${CODENAME} main
     deb-src [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/tor-archive-keyring.gpg] https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org ${CODENAME} main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/tor.list
     ```

   - Import repository key:

     ```sh
     curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org/A3C4F0F979CAA22CDBA8F512EE8CBC9E886DDD89.asc | gpg --dearmor | tee /usr/share/keyrings/tor-archive-keyring.gpg >/dev/null
     ```

   - Update repository index:

     ```sh
     apt update
     ```

   - Install `tor` package:

     ```sh
     apt install -y tor deb.torproject.org-keyring
     ```

2. Configure tor:

   - File configuration:
  
     Open tor configuration with your editor of choice (`nano`,`vim`,`emacs`,etc.):

     ```sh
     vim /etc/tor/torrc
     ```

     And insert the following lines to the bottom of configuration. Please note lines starting with `#`: this is comments about each individual options.

     ```sh
     # Enable log (otherwise, tor doesn't seemd to deploy onion address)
     Log notice file /var/log/tor/notices.log
     # Enable single hop routing (2 options below are dependencies of third). Will reduce latency in exchange of anonimity (since tor runs alongside xftp-server and onion address will be displayed in clients, this is totally fine)
     SOCKSPort 0
     HiddenServiceNonAnonymousMode 1
     HiddenServiceSingleHopMode 1
     # xftp-server hidden service host directory and port mappings
     HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/simplex-xftp/
     HiddenServicePort 443 localhost:443
     ```

   - Create directories:

     ```sh
     mkdir /var/lib/tor/simplex-xftp/ && chown debian-tor:debian-tor /var/lib/tor/simplex-xftp/ && chmod 700 /var/lib/tor/simplex-xftp/
     ```

3. Start tor:

   Enable `systemd` service and start tor. Offical `tor` is a bit flunky on the first start and may not create onion host address, so we're restarting it just in case.

   ```sh
   systemctl enable tor && systemctl start tor && systemctl restart tor
   ```

4. Display onion host:

   Execute the following command to display your onion host address:

   ```sh
   cat /var/lib/tor/simplex-xftp/hostname
   ```

## Configuration

To see which options are available, execute `xftp-server` without flags:

```sh
sudo su xftp -c xftp-server

...
Available commands:
  init                     Initialize server - creates /etc/opt/simplex-xftp and
                           /var/opt/simplex-xftp directories and configuration
                           files
  start                    Start server (configuration:
                           /etc/opt/simplex-xftp/file-server.ini)
  delete                   Delete configuration and log files

```

You can get further help by executing `su xftp -c "xftp-server <command> -h"`

After that, we need to configure `xftp-server`:

```sh
sudo su xftp -c "xftp-server init -h"

...
Available options:
  -l,--store-log           Enable store log for persistence
  -a,--sign-algorithm ALG  Signature algorithm used for TLS certificates:
                           ED25519, ED448 (default: ED448)
  --ip IP                  Server IP address, used as Common Name for TLS online
                           certificate if FQDN is not supplied
                           (default: "127.0.0.1")
  -n,--fqdn FQDN           Server FQDN used as Common Name for TLS online
                           certificate
  -p,--path PATH           Path to the directory to store files
  -q,--quota QUOTA         File storage quota (e.g. 100gb)
  -h,--help                Show this help text
```

You should determine which flags are needed for your use-case and then execute `xftp-server init`:

```sh
sudo su xftp -c "xftp-server init -<your flag> <your option>"
```

For example, run:

```sh
sudo su xftp -c "xftp-server init -l --ip 192.168.1.5 -q '20gb' -p /srv/xftp/"
```

to initialize your `xftp-server` configuration with:

- restoring connections when the server is restarted (`-l` flag),
- IP address `192.168.1.5` (`--ip` flag),
- set overall storage quota to 10Gb (`-q` flag),
- store files in `/srv/xftp` directory (`-p` flag).

To password-protect your `xftp-server`, change it in the configuration:

   1. Open configuration with:
      
      ```sh
      sudo su xftp -c "vim /etc/opt/simplex-xftp/file-server.ini"
      ```
   2. Under `[AUTH]` section uncomment `create_password` and change it:
  
      ```sh
      ...
      [AUTH]
      # Set new_files option to off to completely prohibit uploading new files.
      # This can be useful when you want to decommission the server, but still allow downloading the existing files.
      new_files: on
      
      # Use create_password option to enable basic auth to upload new files.
      # The password should be used as part of server address in client configuration:
      # xftp://fingerprint:password@host1,host2
      # The password will not be shared with file recipients, you must share it only
      # with the users who you want to allow uploading files to your server.
      create_password: your_very_secure_password
      ...
      ```
---

After that, your installation is complete and you should see in your teminal output something like this:

```sh
Certificate request self-signature ok
subject=CN = 192.168.1.5
Server initialized, you can modify configuration in /etc/opt/simplex-xftp/file-server.ini.
Run `file-server start` to start server.
----------
You should store CA private key securely and delete it from the server.
If server TLS credential is compromised this key can be used to sign a new one, keeping the same server identity and established connections.
CA private key location:
/etc/opt/simplex-xftp/ca.key
----------
SimpleX XFTP server v0.1.0
Fingerprint: ioyYeRyy4SqJkNvb_7nM04MuLasOM4c-acVyVnqw248=
Server address: xftp://ioyYeRyy4SqJkNvb_7nM04MuLasOM4c-acVyVnqw248=@<hostnames>
```

The server address above should be used in your client configuration and if you added server password it should only be shared with the other people when you want to allow them to use your server to upload files. If you passed IP address or hostnames during the initialisation, they will be printed as part of server address, otherwise replace `<hostnames>` with the actual server addresses.

## Documentation

All necessary files for `xftp-server` are located in `/etc/opt/simplex-xftp/` folder.

Stored messages, connections, statistics and server log are located in `/var/opt/simplex-xftp/` folder.

Location of uploaded files is configured by the user. In our guide we're using `/srv/xftp/`

### XFTP server address

XFTP server address has the following format:

```
xftp://<fingerprint>[:<password>]@<public_hostname>[,<onion_hostname>]
```

- `<fingerprint>`

  Your `xftp-server` fingerprint of certificate. You can check your certificate fingerprint in `/etc/opt/simplex-xftp/fingerprint`.

- **optional** `<password>`

  Your configured password of `xftp-server`. You can check your configured pasword in `/etc/opt/simplex-xftp/file-server.ini`, under `[AUTH]` section in `create_password:` field.

- `<public_hostname>`, **optional** `<onion_hostname>`

  Your configured hostname(s) of `xftp-server`. You can check your configured hosts in `/etc/opt/simplex-xftp/file-server.ini`, under `[TRANSPORT]` section in `host:` field.

### Systemd commands

To start `xftp-server` on host boot, run:

```sh
sudo systemctl enable xftp-server.service

### Control port

Enabling control port in the configuration allows administrator to see information about the smp-server in real-time. Additionally, it allows to delete file chunks for content moderation and see the debug info about the clients, sockets, etc. Enabling the control port requires setting the `admin` and `user` passwords.

1. Generate two passwords for each user:

   ```sh
   tr -dc A-Za-z0-9 </dev/urandom | head -c 20; echo
   ```

2. Open the configuration file:

   ```sh
   vim /etc/opt/simplex-xftp/file-server.ini
   ```

2. Configure the control port and replace the passwords:

   ```ini
   [AUTH]
   control_port_admin_password: <your_randomly_generated_admin_password>
   control_port_user_password: <your_randomly_generated_user_password>

   [TRANSPORT]
   control_port: 5224
   ```

3. Restart the server:

   ```sh
   systemctl restart xftp-server
   ```

To access the control port, use:

```sh
nc 127.0.0.1 5224
```

or:

```sh
telnet 127.0.0.1 5224
```

Upon connecting, the control port should print:

```sh
XFTP server control port
'help' for supported commands
```

To authenticate, type the following and hit enter. Change the `my_generated_password` with the `user` or `admin` password from the configuration:

```sh
auth my_generated_password
```

Here's the full list of commands, their descriptions and who can access them.

| Command          | Description                                                                     | Requires `admin` role      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `stats-rts`      | GHC/Haskell statistics. Can be enabled with `+RTS -T -RTS` option               | -                          |
| `delete`         | Delete known file chunk. Useful for content moderation.                         | -                          |
| `help`           | Help menu.                                                                      | -                          |
| `quit`           | Exit the control port.                                                          | -                          |

### Daily statistics

You can enable `xftp-server` statistics for `Grafana` dashboard by setting value `on` in `/etc/opt/simplex-xftp/file-server.ini`, under `[STORE_LOG]` section in `log_stats:` field.

Logs will be stored as `csv` file in `/var/opt/simplex-xftp/file-server-stats.daily.log`. Fields for the `csv` file are:

```sh
fromTime,filesCreated,fileRecipients,filesUploaded,filesDeleted,dayCount,weekCount,monthCount,fileDownloads,fileDownloadAcks,filesCount,filesSize
```

- `fromTime` - timestamp; date and time of event

- `filesCreated` - int; chunks created

- `fileRecipients` - int; number of file chunks recipients

- `filesUploaded` - int; chunks uploaded

- `filesDeleted` - int; chunks deleted

- `dayCount` - int; uploaded chunks in a day

- `weekCount` - int; uploaded chunks in a week

- `monthCount` - int; uploaded chunks in a month

- `fileDownloads` - int; chunks downloaded

- `filesCount` - int; count of stored file chunks

- `filesSize` - int; total size of uploaded file chunks


To import `csv` to `Grafana` one should:

1. Install Grafana plugin: [Grafana - CSV datasource](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/marcusolsson-csv-datasource/)

2. Allow local mode by appending following:

   ```sh
   [plugin.marcusolsson-csv-datasource]
   allow_local_mode = true
   ```

   ... to `/etc/grafana/grafana.ini`

3. Add a CSV data source:

   - In the side menu, click the Configuration tab (cog icon)
   - Click Add data source in the top-right corner of the Data Sources tab
   - Enter "CSV" in the search box to find the CSV data source
   - Click the search result that says "CSV"
   - In URL, enter a file that points to CSV content

4. You're done! You should be able to create your own dashboard with statistics.

For further documentation, see: [CSV Data Source for Grafana - Documentation](https://grafana.github.io/grafana-csv-datasource/)
