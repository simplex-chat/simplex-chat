## Individual Contributor License Agreement v1.1

Thank you for your interest in contributing to open source software projects ("Projects") made available by SimpleX Chat or its affiliates ("SimpleX"). This Individual Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement") sets out the terms governing any source code, bug fixes, configuration changes, tools, specifications, documentation, data, materials, feedback, information or other works of authorship that you submit or have submitted, in any form and in any manner, to SimpleX in respect of any of the Projects (collectively "Contributions"). If you have any questions regarding this Agreement, please contact chat@simplex.chat.

You agree that the following terms apply to all of your past, present and future Contributions. Except for the licenses granted in this Agreement, you retain all of your right, title and interest in and to your Contributions.

1. Grant of Copyright License. You hereby grant, and agree to grant, to SimpleX a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, no-charge, royalty-free, transferable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, and distribute your Contributions and such derivative works, with the right to sublicense the foregoing rights through multiple tiers of sublicensees.

2. Grant of Patent License. You hereby grant, and agree to grant, to SimpleX a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, no-charge, royalty-free, transferable patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer your Contributions, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by you that are necessarily infringed by your Contributions alone or by combination of your Contributions with the Project to which such Contributions were submitted, with the right to sublicense the foregoing rights through multiple tiers of sublicensees.

3. Moral Rights. To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, you hereby waive, and agree not to assert, all of your "moral rights" in or relating to your Contributions for the benefit of SimpleX, its assigns, and their respective direct and indirect sublicensees.

4. Third Party Content/Rights. If your Contribution includes or is based on any source code, bug fixes, configuration changes, tools, specifications, documentation, data, materials, feedback, information or other works of authorship that were not authored by you ("Third Party Content") or if you are aware of any third party intellectual property or proprietary rights associated with your Contribution ("Third Party Rights"), then you agree to include with the submission of your Contribution full details respecting such Third Party Content and Third Party Rights, including, without limitation, identification of which aspects of your Contribution contain Third Party Content or are associated with Third Party Rights, the owner/author of the Third Party Content and Third Party Rights, where you obtained the Third Party Content, and any applicable third party license terms or restrictions respecting the Third Party Content and Third Party Rights. For greater certainty, the foregoing obligations respecting the identification of Third Party Content and Third Party Rights do not apply to any portion of a Project that is incorporated into your Contribution to that same Project.

5. You represent that, other than the Third Party Content and Third Party Rights identified by you in accordance with this Agreement, you are the sole author of your Contributions and are legally entitled to grant the foregoing licenses and waivers in respect of your Contributions. If your Contributions were created in the course of your employment with your past or present employer(s), you represent that such employer(s) has authorized you to make your Contributions on behalf of such employer(s) or such employer(s) has waived all of their right, title or interest in or to your Contributions.

6. To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, your Contributions are provided on an "as is" basis, without any warranties or conditions, express or implied, including, without limitation, any implied warranties or conditions of non-infringement, merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. You are not required to provide support for your Contributions, except to the extent you desire to provide support.

7. You acknowledge that SimpleX is under no obligation to use or incorporate your Contributions into any of the Projects. The decision to use or incorporate your Contributions into any of the Projects will be made at the sole discretion of SimpleX or its authorized delegates.

8. You agree that SimpleX may assign this Agreement, and all of its rights, obligations and licenses hereunder.

9. You agree to notify SimpleX of any facts or circumstances of which you become aware that would make these representations inaccurate in any respect.
