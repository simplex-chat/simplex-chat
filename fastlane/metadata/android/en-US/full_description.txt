<h1>SimpleX - the first messaging platform that has no user identifiers, not even random numbers!</h1>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>End-to-end encrypted messages, images and files with editing, replies and deletion.</li>
  <li>Single-use and long-term user addresses.</li>
  <li>Secret chat groups - only group members know it exists and who is the member.</li>
  <li>Audio and video calls.</li>
  <li>Private instant notifications.</li>
  <li>Portable chat profile - you can transfer your chat contacts and history to another device (terminal or mobile).</li>
</ul>
<p>SimpleX advantages:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Full privacy of your identity, profile, contacts and metadata</strong>: unlike any other existing messaging platform, SimpleX uses no phone numbers or any other identifiers assigned to the users - not even random numbers. This protects the privacy of who you are communicating with, hiding it from SimpleX platform servers and from any observers.</li>
  <li><strong>Complete protection against spam and abuse</strong>: as you have no identifier on SimpleX platform, you cannot be contacted unless you share a one-time invitation link or an optional temporary user address.</li>
  <li><strong>Full ownership, control and security of your data</strong>: SimpleX stores all user data on client devices, the messages are only held temporarily on SimpleX relay servers until they are received.</li>
  <li><strong>Decentralized network</strong>: you can use SimpleX with your own servers and still communicate with people using the servers that are pre-configured in the apps or any other SimpleX servers.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can connect to anybody you know via link or scan QR code (in the video call or in person) and start sending messages instantly - no emails, phone numbers or passwords needed.</p> 
<p>Your profile and contacts are only stored in the app on your device - our servers do not have access to this information.</p>
<p>All messages are end-to-end encrypted using open-source double-ratchet protocol; the messages are routed via our servers using open-source SimpleX Messaging Protocol.</p>
