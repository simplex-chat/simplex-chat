# Wired’s Misleading Attack on Privacy of Communications

<img src="./images/20241016-wired-privacy.jpg" width="330" class="float-to-right">

The [Wired article](https://www.wired.com/story/neo-nazis-flee-telegram-encrypted-app-simplex/) by David Gilbert is biased and misleading. By cherry-picking information from [the report](https://www.isdglobal.org/digital_dispatches/neo-nazi-accelerationists-seek-new-digital-refuge-amid-looming-telegram-crackdown/) by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD), Wired constructs a skewed narrative, focusing on who uses privacy-preserving technologies, ignoring the vital role of privacy in democratic societies. The article fails to mention that SimpleX network design and features prioritize privacy and anonymity in order to protect human rights defenders, journalists, and everyday users who value their privacy. Many ordinary families feel safer using SimpleX than non-private apps, because SimpleX makes it impossible for strangers to approach them.

Filtering the facts to fit the story, instead of telling the story that describes the facts, is a violation of journalism ethics about factual reporting. It also creates a real harm to democracy, as it frames privacy as something negative to their audience, &mdash; and democratic governance is impossible without privacy.

SimpleX network offers [strong end-to-end encryption](./20240314-simplex-chat-v5-6-quantum-resistance-signal-double-ratchet-algorithm.md#how-secure-is-end-to-end-encryption-in-different-messengers) and privacy, and that’s why it is becoming the communication network of choice for a growing number of people. To paint this as problematic solely because some extremist groups may use SimpleX or any other privacy-focussed apps misses the broader, critical context.

SimpleX’s true strength lies in protection of users' metadata. We wrote before about [the dangers of metadata in messengers](./20240416-dangers-of-metadata-in-messengers.md). For countless people, especially vulnerable groups, these features are literally life-saving. Wired article ignores these essential protections, and overlooks the positive aspects of having such a unique design, as noted both in the ISD report and in another publication which [they link to](https://www.maargentino.com/is-telegrams-privacy-shift-driving-extremists-toward-simplex/):

> *“SimpleX also has a significant advantage when it comes to protecting metadata &mdash; the information that can reveal who you’re talking to, when, and how often. SimpleX is designed with privacy at its core, minimizing the amount of metadata collected and ensuring that any temporary data necessary for functionality is not retained or linked to identifiable users.”*

Both publications referenced by Wired also comment on how SimpleX design hinders extremist groups from spreading propaganda or building large networks. SimpleX design restricts message visibility and file retention, making it far from ideal for those looking to coordinate large networks. Yet these important qualities are ignored by Wired in favor of fear-mongering about encryption &mdash; an argument we've seen before when apps like Signal [faced similar treatment](https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/03/13/telegram-signal-apps-right-wing-extremism-islamic-state-terrorism-violence-europol-encrypted/). Ironically, Wired just a month earlier encouraged its readers to [adopt encrypted messaging apps](https://www.wired.com/story/gadget-lab-podcast-657/), making its current stance on encryption and privacy contradictory.

The vilification of apps that offer critically important privacy, anonymity, and encryption must stop. That some small share of users may abuse these tools doesn’t justify broad criticism. Additionally, the lobbying for client-side scanning, which Wired’s article seems to indirectly endorse, is not only dangerous but goes against fundamental principles of human right to privacy, free speech and personal security. A very large number of people object to private communications being used for any kind of monitoring, including AI training, which would undermine the very trust encryption is designed to build.

It’s alarming to see Wired not only criticize SimpleX for its strong privacy protections but also subtly blame the European Court of Human Rights for upholding basic human rights by rejecting the law that would force encrypted apps to scan and hand over private messages before encryption. David Gilbert (Wired) writes:

> *…SimpleX doesn’t indiscriminately scan all content because of a European Court of Human Rights decision in February of this year, which ruled that forcing encrypted messaging apps to provide a backdoor to law enforcement was illegal. This decision undermined the EU’s controversial proposal that would potentially force encrypted messaging apps to scan all user content for identifiers of child sexual abuse material.*

The framing of [the European Court of Human Rights decision](https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/15/echr_backdoor_encryption/) as something that *undermines* EU efforts to reduce CSAM distribution is inappropriate and misguided. It plays into the hands of anti-privacy lobbyists aiming to make private communications unavailable to ordinary people. Framing privacy and anonymity as tools for criminals ignores the reality that these protections are essential for millions of legitimate users, from activists to journalists, to ordinary citizens. Not only client-side scanning will fail to reduce CSAM distribution any better than already available measures, but it will result in the increase of crime and abuse when (not if!) criminals get access to this data, and it will allow for non-consensual training of AI models on private communications of all users.

We need to correct this narrative. The real danger lies not in protecting communication, but in failing to do so. Privacy communications that apps like SimpleX provide are crucial, not just for those resisting mass surveillance, but for everyone who values the right to communicate without fear of their conversations being monitored or misused. This is a right we must defend and incorporate into law. We wrote before that strong end-to-end encryption is [required to protect children safety](./20240601-protecting-children-safety-requires-e2e-encryption.md) and that to reduce crime online we must [make privacy a legal obligation](./20240704-future-of-privacy-enforcing-privacy-standards.md) of communication providers..

Wired did not respond to our request for comment, but we would be happy to engage in an open dialogue about the role of privacy in technology and society. Wired should stand on the right side of this debate and help normalize the demand for privacy protections by law, genuinely protecting people from criminals and from the exploitation via mass surveillance and AI training. If Wired choses to continue spreading fear and uncertainty about encrypted messaging and tools that enable privacy and anonymity, it will lose the trust and respect of its audience, that is already undermined by its recent editorial policy. We and many other independent technologists would be happy to help Wired to express the views that better reflect the values of its audience and of democratic society.
