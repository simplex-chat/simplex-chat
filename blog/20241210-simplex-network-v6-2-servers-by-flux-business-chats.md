## Please support us with your donations

Huge *thank you* to everybody who donated to SimpleX Chat!

Prioritizing users privacy and security, and also raising the investment, would have been impossible without your support and donations.

Also, funding the work to transition the protocols to non-profit governance model would not have been possible without the donations we received from the users.

Our pledge to our users is that SimpleX protocols are and will remain open, and in public domain, so anybody can build the future implementations of the clients and the servers. We are building SimpleX platform based on the same principles as email and web, but much more private and secure.

Your donations help us raise more funds &mdash; any amount, even the price of the cup of coffee, makes a big difference for us.

See [this section](https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplex-chat/#please-support-us-with-your-donations) for the ways to donate.

Thank you,

Evgeny

SimpleX Chat founder
