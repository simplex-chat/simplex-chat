# SimpleX network: privacy preserving content moderation

**Will be published:** Jan 12, 2025

This blog post will cover our approach to removing CSAM that has:
- NO user identification, thus preserving privacy of the users.
- NO client- or server-side content scanning, thus preserving privacy and security of e2e encryption.

The current and future content restriction will only be applied based on the users' complaints, and only to the content that can be accessed by server operators via public channels.
