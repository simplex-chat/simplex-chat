#!/bin/bash

# Starts the desktop app on a virtual display and runs the scripted UI cases with the ui helper: onboarding to the
# chat list, a local group, then the chat list with the toolbar at the bottom (the default) and at the top, then
# tests/fixtures/test.jpg and logo-large-rgba.png picked in the file dialog and sent in the group.
# Usage: scripts/ci/desktop-linux/smoke-test.sh <app dir> <output dir> [start|onboarding|layouts|setup|backend]
# With "start" it stops at the first screen, for an agent to go on from; with "onboarding", at the chat list.
# "setup" creates the group, makes the test SMP server (backend.sh) the one that resolves SimpleX names, and stops;
# "backend" does the same, connects to the name that backend.sh registered, and goes on to both layouts.
# Both need NAMES_SERVER, the test SMP server's address.
# Each step saves a numbered screenshot and the text read from it to the output dir, prints the text to the log,
# and adds a line to steps.log there. What the screens show is checked without stopping: every check is listed in
# checks.txt and the job summary, and the test fails at the end if any failed. The app keeps running for later
# steps of the job, which get UI_OUT.
