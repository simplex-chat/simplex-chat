    <p>SimpleX - the first messaging platform that has no user identifiers, not even random numbers!</p>
    <p>Security assessment was done by Trail of Bits in November 2022.</p>
    <p>SimpleX Chat features:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>end-to-end encrypted messages, with editing, replies and deletion of messages.</li>
      <li>sending end-to-end encrypted images and files.</li>
      <li>single-use and long-term user addresses.</li>
      <li>secret chat groups - only group members know it exists and who is the member.</li>
      <li>end-to-end encrypted audio and video calls.</li>
      <li>private instant notifications.</li>
      <li>portable chat profile - you can transfer your chat contacts and history to another device (terminal or mobile).</li>
    </ol>
    <p>SimpleX Chat advantages:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><em>Full privacy of your identity, profile, contacts and metadata:</em> unlike any other existing messaging platform, SimpleX uses no phone numbers or any other identifiers assigned to the users - not even random numbers. This protects the privacy of who you are communicating with, hiding it from SimpleX platform servers and from any observers.</li>
      <li><em>Complete protection against spam and abuse:</em> as you have no identifier on SimpleX platform, you cannot be contacted unless you share a one-time invitation link or an optional temporary user address.</li>
      <li><em>Full ownership, control and security of your data:</em> SimpleX stores all user data on client devices, the messages are only held temporarily on SimpleX relay servers until they are received.</li>
      <li><em>Decentralized network:</em> you can use SimpleX with your own servers and still communicate with people using the servers that are pre-configured in the apps or any other SimpleX servers.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>You can connect to anybody you know via link or scan QR code (in the video call or in person) and start sending messages instantly - no emails, phone numbers or passwords needed.</p>
    <p>Your profile and contacts are only stored in the app on your device - our servers do not have access to this information.</p>
    <p>All messages are end-to-end encrypted using open-source double-ratchet protocol; the messages are routed via our servers using open-source SimpleX Messaging Protocol.</p>
