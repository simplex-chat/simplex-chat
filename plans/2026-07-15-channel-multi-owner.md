# Channel multi-owner

N equal owners per channel, per `docs/protocol/channels-overview.md` §Governance ("v7: Multiple owners, any-owner-decides"). Any owner can take any administrative action, including destroying the channel. No coordination between owners.

## 1. What an owner must do

1. Publish content, and publish as the channel.
2. Sign admin messages subscribers accept — profile, prefs, member removal, role changes, relay announcements, deletion.
3. Change member/moderator/admin roles — i.e. sign the roster.
4. Write link data — relays, profile, member count, the owners list.
5. Add another owner.

Only the creator can do 2, 4, 5 today; 3 works for one owner at a time. Each is enforced somewhere different. 4 reaches into simplexmq.

## 2. Current state

**simplexmq is already built for this, unwired.** `UserContactData.owners :: [OwnerAuth]`, `validateLinkOwners` (each entry signed by root *or an earlier entry*), `decryptLinkData` (accepts data signed by root *or any listed owner*) — all multi-owner-correct. `ShortLinkCreds.linkRootSigKey` exists, commented *"in case the current user is not the original owner"*. `RKEY :: NonEmpty RcvPublicAuthKey` and `recipientKeys :: NonEmpty` shipped in `b7a95422` *"smp server: short links and owners for channels"* at SMP client v4 = current, so every channel-capable server accepts it. **The agent never calls RKEY.**

**Blockers in simplexmq:**
- `AgentStore.hs:2514` — `linkRootSigKey = Nothing` on every load, no column (`-- TODO linkRootSigKey should be stored in a separate field`). The non-root branch of `validateOwners` is dead code.
- `Crypto/ShortLink.hs:80` — `newOwnerAuth` generates the key pair locally; adding a remote owner must sign a supplied public key. The formula is duplicated in chat at `Internal.hs:1519`.

**The single-owner assumption is one function.** `groupLinkData` (`Internal.hs:1509`, `-- TODO [relays] owner: set owners on updating link data (multi-owner)`) rebuilds `owners` on every publish as a singleton of *self*, and as `[]` without `GRKPrivate`. So a second owner is never published; two owners publishing would evict each other; a non-root owner would publish an empty list, making link data unreadable to everyone.

**Owners are not in the roster, by design.** `isRosterRole = GRMember|GRModerator|GRAdmin` (`Internal.hs:1281`: *"owners are on the link, not the roster"*); link data is the sole authority for owner keys (`Groups.hs:3533`). Preserved. `updateGroupFromLinkData` carries only profile + count, so a new owner goes into link data **and** is announced by a signed `x.grp.mem.role`.

**`APIMembersRole … GROwner` is not rejected today** — only the iOS/Kotlin pickers block it. Via CLI it half-works: skips the owner-only guard (`isRosterRole GROwner == False`), sends no key, publishes nothing, and leaves the promoted device throwing `SEGroupLinkNotFound` from `updatePublicGroupData` on every `x.grp.mem.new`. §3 replaces that path.

## 3. Protocol

`APIMembersRole … GROwner` on a channel triggers this instead of a plain role change: two-phase, async, returns "invitation sent".

The invitee must already be a channel member — its key is then known, and its relay connections exist (a subscriber creates `GRRelay`/`GCHostMember` rows, so `getGroupRelayMembers` returns them for a promoted subscriber unchanged). **Its key must also be verified out of band (§8).**

Two events, both `requiresSignature`, over the existing relay connections. Named for promotion, not ownership: a later release promoting to any role reuses them; only the link fields are owner-specific.

```
x.grp.promote.inv    { invitationId, memberRole, linkRcvId? }   -- O1 -> M
x.grp.promote.acpt   { invitationId, memberKey, linkRcvKey? }   -- M  -> O1
```

- `memberRole` — carried though acceptance is automatic, so a later release can add accept/reject without a wire change.
- `invitationId` — binds the acceptance to one invitation; blocks relay replay.
- `memberKey` — M's existing member key. O1 already holds it and **must** check they match and abort otherwise, so a promotion can never introduce a key.
- `linkRcvId` / `linkRcvKey` — the link queue's recipient ID, and a fresh recipient auth **public** key M generates. Owner promotions only.

Everything else M needs to write link data is public or derivable: `shortLinkKey`/`shortLinkId` from the channel link; fixed-data plaintext (hence `rootPubKey`) via `LGET`, re-encrypted under a fresh nonce — readers check `sha3_256(fd) == linkKey` and the root signature over the *plaintext*.

No third credentials message: `linkRcvId` authorises nothing on its own (`Server.hs:1249` verifies every recipient command against `recipientKeys`), which is equally why the relay carrying these learns nothing. A decliner is never RKEY'd and never enters the link.

O1 on acceptance, via a durable worker (mirror `runRelayRequestWorker` — multi-step, cross-network, must survive a crash):

1. Add `linkRcvKey` to the link queue's recipient keys (see below — `RKEY` as shipped cannot do this).
2. `LSET` — publish `owners = [oa1, …, oaN, mkOwnerAuth memberId2 memberKey signingKey]`.
3. `x.grp.mem.role memberId2 GROwner (Just memberKey)` → relays → subscribers.

**Step 1 needs an additive RKEY.** `RKEY :: NonEmpty RcvPublicAuthKey` *replaces* the whole list (`updateKeys st sq rKeys = … q {recipientKeys = rKeys}`), and nothing reads it back — `QueueInfo` carries `qiSnd`/`qiNtf`/`qiSub`/`qiSize`/`qiMsg` and no keys. So a writer must already know every key in the list. The creator does, having issued every RKEY. **A promoted owner does not, and never can** — so owner 2 adding owner 3 would RKEY a list built from its own knowledge and silently evict owner 1's link-write capability. That defeats the point of equal owners.

Publishing each owner's recipient key in link data would fix the knowledge gap but not the race: `RKEY` has no compare-and-swap, so two owners adding concurrently would each write a list missing the other's addition. An **additive** RKEY needs neither — the caller supplies one key, cannot evict anyone by construction, and two concurrent additions both land. Removal keeps the existing replace semantics, and is deferred (§11). The server caps the list.

This is the same version bump as compare-and-swap, so the marginal cost is one command.

**The role event is the commit point.** M must not treat itself as an owner on sending the acceptance, only on receiving `x.grp.mem.role` for itself — which the existing `xGrpMemRole` self-branch (`Subscriber.hs:3338`) already applies. O1 sends it only after 1 and 2 succeed, so the event means *the link says you are an owner*. Set the role earlier and any failure or crash between acceptance and LSET leaves M believing it is an owner while absent from the chain: it would write link data and be refused, and sign admin messages that every subscriber rejects, since its key is not in the published owners.

Each step must therefore be idempotent and resumable — on restart the worker re-reads the published chain and skips what has landed. If O1 never completes, M stays pending, holding an unused `linkRcvId` and a `linkRcvKey` that was never RKEY'd, and the invitation expires on the same pattern as `relayRequestExpiry`.

LSET precedes the broadcast so a joiner in the window learns the owner from the link, not by TOFU. Once published, M's entry cannot be evicted by another owner's write: `owners` merges as published-plus-mine (§4.2).

## 4. Concurrency

No consensus between owners: "any-owner-decides" is defined by its absence, owners are sleeping phones reachable only through relays (a relay could partition them and freeze governance), adding owners *is* reconfiguration — the hardest part of consensus — and quorum would mean losing an owner can stop the channel, inverting the point of the feature.

Convergence without coordination instead. The two shared states differ in storage, so they take different standard answers: link data is one copy on a server → optimistic concurrency; the roster has a copy per relay and no central store → last-writer-wins with a deterministic timestamp. The subscriber count stops being shared state once relay-derived.

### 4.1 Roster: same version, two owners, multiple relays

```
O1 -> R1,R2 : roster N (content A)
O2 -> R1,R2 : roster N (content B)
R1 sees A then B: fresh = N >= N -> applies B    -> R1 = B
R2 sees B then A: fresh = N >= N -> applies A    -> R2 = A
```

Permanent divergence: `fresh = maybe True (v >=) gate` (`Subscriber.hs:3302`; `notBelowRoster` `:3430` for the blob) is not a total order, so at equal versions the winner is whoever arrived last.

**Fix: tie-break on the author's `memberId`** — accept iff `(v, authorMemberId) >= (gate_v, gate_authorMemberId)`. `memberId` is 12 random bytes, identical on every device, so every node picks the same winner and both relays converge on B regardless of order. Keep `>=` not `>`: an equal tuple from the same owner must still accept (`Subscriber.hs:3288-3291`). `roster_sending_owner_gm_id` exists on `groups` but is a **local row id**, not comparable across devices → add `roster_version_owner_id BLOB`.

**Rosters must reach owners.** `sendRosterBlob` targets `getGroupRelayMembers` only and the relay→subscriber broadcast was deliberately removed, so an owner never sees another's roster and its counter goes stale. Relays forward `XGrpRoster` + `BFileChunk`s to `GROwner` members excluding the author — bounded fan-out, owners only.

The loser's change is dropped: it adopts the winner's roster and self-corrects. **No auto-retry** — re-applying a delta to a whole-value object is two owners fighting. UI surfaces the revert; the user re-applies if they still want it.

Frontier logic is unaffected: the counter stays one shared sequence, so no gaps in `nextCompleteVersion`.

### 4.2 Link data: concurrent LSET

One queue on one server, so writes serialise and stored state never diverges. Two defects make a lost write possible and invisible:

- **Every write is a blind whole-object overwrite.** `groupLinkData` rebuilds the entire `UserContactData` from local state — each publish asserts *the whole link is what I think it is*, including fields the writer knows nothing about. Right for one writer, wrong for N.
- **An owner's confirmation is its own echo.** `notify $ LINK link userLinkData` (`Agent.hs:1813`) returns the data the *client sent*, not the server's state, and relay activation (`Subscriber.hs:1411-1458`) reads `relays` out of that echo to promote relays to `RSActive`. So an owner marks a relay active because it asked for it. With N writers: the owner adds a relay, another owner's publish drops it, the relay's own `checkRelayServedGroups` sees its link missing and goes `RSInactive`, and the adding owner still shows it active. Nothing reads back the truth.

Every loss here is damaging — a dropped relay silently stops serving, a dropped owner entry leaves an accepted invitee unpublished, a dropped profile update vanishes.

**Count comes from relays.** `publicMemberCount` is published per join/leave from six sites (`Subscriber.hs:3137/3152/3170/3658/3705`, `Commands.hs:3035`). The number is `summary_current_members_count` — a DB-trigger count of rows in *that device's* `group_members` (`M20250919_group_summary.hs:48-81`), i.e. "members I know about". A promoted owner's is permanently low: `introduceInChannel` announces joiners only to `owners <> adminsMods`, so observers never learn of other observers. Sole-publisher-creator only defers it (wrong in perpetuity once they leave); introducing every subscriber to a new owner is O(N) messages and rows for one integer.

The count is **already relay-derived** — an owner has no connection to subscribers, so its tally is just relay-sent `XGrpMemNew`s counted. So the relay states its count in the join/leave announcements it already sends: an optional field on `XGrpMemNew` and its departure counterparts, no new event, no new fan-out. Owners mirror it (max across relays) instead of deriving it. Same trust, no bookkeeping.

**One owner publishes it: the first in the chain, the next taking over if it stops.** All owners still track it, so this is who writes, not who knows — handover needs no catch-up. `owner_auth_index` is identical on every device, so the choice is deterministic and needs no election. Otherwise N owners write per join, N-1 rejected, and the link becomes a target N of them constantly move — which would starve human writes.

Publishing stays per join. `updatePublicGroupData` keeps its trigger — it does double duty and must not be dropped: there is no relay-removal command, a relay is removed by removing the relay *member* (`Commands.hs:3033-3035`) and leaves the link because `getPublishableGroupRelays` requires `member_status = GSMemConnected` (`Store/Groups.hs:1470`); a relay leaving arrives as `xGrpLeave` (`Subscriber.hs:3705`), same path.

This also disposes of the wider worry: the count was the only thing needing a *complete* member list, so a promoted owner's partial one stops mattering. Moderation learns members lazily on first post (`Subscriber.hs:4195`); the roster arrives as a served snapshot on join.

A relay can state a false number, but it can already do that by fabricating or withholding announcements — the threat model records count manipulation as detectable-not-prevented, unchanged.

**Writes become deltas.** `LGET` → apply only this write's delta → `LSET`:

| field | semantics | rule |
|---|---|---|
| `direct` | constant | preserve |
| `owners` | append-only ordered chain (§4.3) | published, my entry appended |
| `relays` | set with meaningful removals | published, ± the one relay this write touches — never my whole local list |
| `groupProfile` | whole object | overwrite only if this write *is* a profile change |
| `publicMemberCount` | relay-reported | overwrite only if this write carries a newer report |

This kills two more failures: a publish can no longer evict another owner, and a profile edit can no longer resurrect a removed relay.

**The merge-and-retry lives in one place.** Callers stop building link data and pass a delta; one function takes the published data, applies the delta, `LSET`s, and on rejection re-merges and retries, bounded. The structure already fits: every group link write funnels through `groupLinkData` via exactly two callers, `setGroupLinkData` (sync) and `setGroupLinkDataAsync` (async). Channel creation is exempt — first write, nothing to conflict with.

The async path loops chat-side, not in the agent: `setConnShortLinkAsync` enqueues fully-built data and executes it later (`Agent.hs:1811`), so a rejection can arrive long after the caller returned, and the agent cannot re-merge — merge policy is chat's. So async callers enqueue a delta to a per-group link worker, which also serialises this owner's own writes.

**Compare-and-swap on `LSET`.** "Write this, but only if what is stored is still what I read." The writer passes a fingerprint — a hash of the stored user-data bytes its merge was based on — and the server stores only if the current bytes still hash to that; else it rejects, stores nothing, **and returns the current data**, so the retry needs no read.

```
without CAS                              with CAS
O1: warm at {News, [R1,R2]}              O1: warm at {News, [R1,R2]}  digest a
O2: warm at {News, [R1,R2]}              O2: warm at {News, [R1,R2]}  digest a
O1: LSET {News,  [R1,R2,R3]}   stored    O1: LSET expect a {News, [R1,R2,R3]}  -> OK, now b
O2: LSET {Daily, [R1,R2]}      stored    O2: LSET expect a {Daily, [R1,R2]}    -> REJECTED
                                              + returns {News, [R1,R2,R3]}, digest b
= R3 silently gone, stops serving.       O2: LSET expect b {Daily, [R1,R2,R3]} -> OK
  O1 still shows it active.              = both changes survive.
```

| | uncontended | contended |
|---|---|---|
| today (single writer) | 1 — `LSET` | n/a |
| merge, write blind | 1 — `LSET` | 1, silently lost |
| merge, write, verify | 3 — `LGET`, `LSET`, `LGET` | 3, hole remains |
| **compare-and-swap** | **1 — `LSET`** | **2 — rejected `LSET`, `LSET`** |

So it is not a correctness tax on the cheap design; it *is* the cheap design, and it removes machinery: no verify read, no durable per-write intent, no retry-until-observed loop, no residual hole.

Details:
- The fingerprint is of the **stored ciphertext** — the server has no key, so it can only hash bytes it holds (`queueData qr`). It doubles as a version token for free: a fresh nonce per write changes the bytes even for identical plaintext.
- A writer knows it only from bytes it has seen: its own successful write (hashed on the way out), an `LGET`, or a rejection. Another owner's write is otherwise opaque — the fresh nonce means it cannot be re-derived from local plaintext. Persisted next to the link credentials.
- **A write is rejected exactly when another owner wrote since you last read or wrote.** Alternating owners pay one extra round trip per alternation. That is optimistic concurrency working as intended.
- It never reaches chat: the agent encrypts, so it computes and keeps the fingerprint with the link credentials, refreshing on every successful write, `LGET` and rejection. Chat gets success, or a conflict carrying the current data decrypted.
- Returning data on rejection leaks nothing: `LGET` needs no signature for a contact queue (`Server.hs:1256`), so link data is already public to any link holder. `LNK` (`Protocol.hs:698`) already carries a whole `QueueLinkData`, so the size is routine. Needs a distinct `BrokerMsg`, not an `ErrorType` — not shaped for a 13.8 KB payload.

**A rejection is not a conflict and does not reach the user.** It says *something* changed, usually not what this writer is changing. Re-read, and if my field is untouched, re-merge and retry — always safe. The user sees a save one round trip later. Only if my field *also* changed is it a real conflict: set-elements still re-merge; whole values yield and report the winning value. That report is the only thing a user sees, it means another owner really did edit the same field seconds earlier, and writing blind gives no error at all in that case — the edit just disappears. Retries are bounded; only exhausting them is a failure.

**On rejection, per write:**

| write | trigger | link write | on rejection |
|---|---|---|---|
| profile / prefs | `runUpdateGroupProfile`, user-facing | **sync** | re-merge, retry; on real conflict abort before the local commit and show the winning value |
| relay add | relay's acceptance → worker | async | worker's existing retry |
| relay remove | member removal → `updatePublicGroupData` | async | worker's existing retry |
| owner add | acceptance → worker (§3) | async | worker's existing retry |
| subscriber count | join / leave | async | drop; the next join publishes again |

**Nothing new is recorded.** A rejection is immediate, so no writer must remember what it wanted in order to notice later that it vanished — that bookkeeping is a cost of writing blind. Sync writes fail to the user, who retries. Async writes already have durable retry state and backoff (`relay_request_retries`/`_delay`/`_execute_at` on `groups`, via `retryTmpError`, `Subscriber.hs:4404`) because they must survive a crash regardless; a rejection is a textbook temporary error, so classifying it as one puts it in the existing loop, and the existing expiry surfaces a relay error if attempts keep failing. Progress is already a state machine — a relay sits at `RSAccepted`/`RSAcknowledgedRoster` until the write lands — so a rejection leaves it pending, nothing to revert. Only fix: activation must key off an accepted write, not the `LINK` echo.

**Profile ordering.** `runUpdateGroupProfile` commits locally (`Commands.hs:4016`) *before* the sync link write (`:4034`), so any failure — rejection, or a plain network error today — leaves the profile changed here and nowhere else. `groupLinkData` is pure, so building link data needs no prior commit: write first, then commit and broadcast. Fixes the existing silent-divergence bug too.

**Learning other owners' changes.** No periodic worker. Three triggers suffice: a rejection returns the current data; a newly promoted owner does one `LGET` to seed its count; and channel open reconciles via the existing `APIGetUpdatedGroupLinkData` (`Commands.hs:1909`) — which already exists and is *owner-excluded* in both layers, backend (`:1918`) and UI (`ChatView.swift:771`, an `else if` that routes owners elsewhere). Removing that exclusion is the whole change. This matters beyond the UI: an owner must connect to relays another owner added, or its posts never reach their subscribers, and `syncSubscriberRelays` is exactly the function that connects to relays listed in link data.

Two owners genuinely disagreeing — one adding a relay, the other removing the same one — is not a race; last writer wins.

### 4.3 Owner chain ordering

`validateLinkOwners` requires each entry to be signed by root or an **earlier** entry. Since owner 2 can add owner 3 with its own key, order is load-bearing and must be persisted, not derived. Two owners concurrently appending is an LSET conflict — one re-merges and retries, appending after the other.

## 5. Backend work (simplex-chat)

**Persist the owners chain.** `owner_auth_sig BLOB NULL` + `owner_auth_index INTEGER NULL` on `group_members` (migration + cabal + SQLite and Postgres). The key is already there as `member_pub_key`, so it cannot drift from the member record, and the index carries §4.3's order.

- `Internal.hs:1509` `groupLinkData` — becomes "apply this delta to the published data": read the stored chain, delete the `GRKPrivate`-derived singleton and the `_ -> []` fallback. Its two callers become the single place owning merge, CAS and bounded retry (§4.2).
- Per-group link worker for async writers (relay connected, roster acked, count) — they enqueue deltas, since the agent cannot re-merge on rejection.
- `Internal.hs:1458` `updatePublicGroupData` — trigger unchanged (still per join/leave, and the only publish for relay removal/departure); number now from relay reports; published only by the designated owner (§4.2).
- `XGrpMemNew` + departure counterparts gain an optional relay-stated count, filled from the number the relay's own `updatePublicGroupData` branch already computes. Owners store it per relay, use the max.
- `Internal.hs:1458`, `Commands.hs:4011` `runUpdateGroupProfile`, `Commands.hs:2713` `APIAddGroupRelays` — gate on `memberRole' membership == GROwner` but need "can write link data" (an owner mid-handover cannot). One predicate, all three.
- `Commands.hs:3268` `APIAddGroupShortLink` — asserts no role at all; same gate.
- `Commands.hs:2872` `APIMembersRole` — route `newRole == GROwner` into §3; require `memberVerifiedCode` on the invitee (§8). The invitation carries the verified key; the acceptance's `memberKey` must equal it or abort, or verification is worthless.
- `Commands.hs:4016` — reorder: write link, then commit and broadcast (§4.2).
- `Subscriber.hs:3345` `allowCreate` — widen so an owner-signed `x.grp.mem.role` with a key can TOFU-create a `GROwner`; `isRosterRole GROwner == False` blocks it today, so subscribers can never materialise a new owner.
- `Commands.hs:2936` `mKey` — send the key on owner promotion, not only when a roster version is present.
- `Subscriber.hs:4195` — "owners are already known to every member" is false for a newly promoted owner; disseminate its profile.
- `Subscriber.hs:1422` — `publicMemberCount > 1` assumes one owner (self-documented TODO). Use a subscriber count or `> ownerCount`.
- `Commands.hs:1918` `syncSubscriberRelays` — run for owners other than the publisher (§4.2).
- `Subscriber.hs:1411-1458` — relay activation must key off an accepted write, not the `LINK` echo, which is self-confirming.
- `Commands.hs:1192` — share-link signing requires `GRKPrivate`, so a promoted owner silently emits `ownerSig = Nothing`. Sign with any listed owner's member key; `verifyLinkOwner` already resolves by `ownerId`.
- `Store/Groups.hs:2320` `updateRelayGroupKeys` — `forM_ owners` exists but `getGroupMemberIdViaMemberId` throws for an owner the relay has no row for, aborting the transaction. Create it — reuse `createLinkOwnerMember`, which the subscriber path already uses for this.
- `Commands.hs:5254` `checkRelayServedGroups` — the relay's periodic worker re-reads link data but binds only `relays`, discarding `owners`. Refresh owners; it is the relay's only path to owner changes.
- `Store/Groups.hs:1117` `getHostMember` — `firstRow` on `GCHostMember`; relays model exactly one owner.
- Roster: tie-break gate (`Subscriber.hs:3302`, `:3430`), `roster_version_owner_id` column, relays forward `XGrpRoster` + chunks to owners (§4.1).
- Durable owner-request worker + table, mirroring the relay-request worker.

## 6. simplexmq work

- `Crypto/ShortLink.hs` — extract `mkOwnerAuth :: OwnerId -> PublicKeyEd25519 -> PrivateKeyEd25519 -> OwnerAuth`; redefine `newOwnerAuth` on it; export. Kills the cross-repo duplicate.
- Persist `linkRootSigKey` — `rcv_queues` column + migration (`AgentStore.hs:2514`).
- Additive RKEY (§3): a new command taking one key and appending it, capped. `RKEY` as shipped replaces the list and nothing reads it back (`QueueInfo` has no keys), so a promoted owner cannot use it without evicting the others. Additive also removes the concurrent-addition race, since `RKEY` has no compare-and-swap. Plus the agent API.
- Link-write API for an owner that does not own the queue. Prefer a standalone `setForeignLinkData` taking explicit creds over faking an `RcvQueue`/`ContactConnection`: the latter needs an `rcvDhSecret` owner 2 must not have, and risks it subscribing to owner 1's queue and racing on inbound requests.
- CAS on `LSET` (§4.2): new command tag carrying the expected fingerprint; new `BrokerMsg` for the rejection carrying current user data; `currentSMPClientVersion` 4 → 5. Server check beside `lnkId' /= lnkId -> err AUTH` (`Server.hs:1484`) — bytes to hash and return are already in `queueData qr`, so no storage change. Agent keeps the fingerprint with link creds. Fall back to blind writes below v5.
- `LINK` notifies with the client's own `userLinkData` (`Agent.hs:1813`) — return the server's state or drop the payload, so callers cannot mistake it for confirmation.

## 7. UI

Already ahead in places: owners are pluralised (`ownersContributorsCountStr`, `ChatInfoToolbar.swift:134` / `ChatView.kt:1550`), the members button checks `members.contains { $0.wrapped.memberRole >= .owner }` (`GroupChatInfoView.swift:128` / `.kt:650`), leave has a `hasOtherOwner` escape hatch (`.swift:250` / `.kt:822`). The gap: `isOwner` is self-relative and count-blind (`membership.memberRole == .owner && membership.memberCurrent`), used ~30× as if it meant *the* owner.

**No model of link-write capability** — `grep groupKeys|GRKPrivate|rootKey` across `apps/` returns zero hits. Two proxies, both wrong once owners are equal:
- `isOwner && groupLink != nil` (`GroupChatInfoView.swift:111`, the `// TODO [relays] allow other owners to manage channel link` site; `.kt:638`). The `groupLink != nil` half is the accidental gate: only the creator has a `user_contact_links` row.
- `isOwner` alone for relay add/remove and status fetch (`ChannelRelaysView.swift:26/48/83`, `.kt:39/90/109`).

Replace both with a backend-supplied `canManageLink` on `GroupInfo` — not equivalent to `isOwner`: an owner mid-handover cannot write. Gate link, relay and domain-claim UI on it.

- `canChangeRoleTo` (`ChatTypes.swift:3060`, `ChatModel.kt:2652`) hard-codes `[.observer, .member]`. Add `.owner`; selecting it starts an async two-phase flow (pending → owner, or failed).
- Promoting to owner warns prominently when the invitee's key is unverified and routes to the existing verification screen. Unlike contact verification the consequence is not one conversation but the channel's trust chain (§8).
- Owners section in channel info; pending-owner state.
- A role change can revert when it loses a tie-break (§4.1) — surface it.
- `ChatView.swift:771` / `Commands.hs:1918` — owners are excluded from the on-open link reconcile; remove the exclusion (§4.2).
- **iOS-only:** `GroupChatInfoView.swift:303` skips `apiGetGroupLink` unless `isOwner`; Kotlin fetches unconditionally (`ChatView.kt:403/428`). Reconcile.
- RULE-19 (`apps/ios/product/rules.md:112`) says a *sole* owner cannot leave. The info view honours it via `hasOtherOwner`; the chat-list menus drop the clause — `showLeaveGroup = … && !(groupInfo.useRelays && groupInfo.isOwner)` (`ChatListNavLink.swift:272`, `:247`; `ChatListNavLinkView.kt:319`, `:341`) — so any channel owner loses Leave in the list even when others exist.

## 8. Security

**The invitee's key must be verified out of band before promoting.** By default an owner's copy of a subscriber's key is relay-asserted: the owner has no connection to subscribers, so everything it knows arrived as `XGrpMemNew`, which is unsigned and relay-authored (`Subscriber.hs:3125`). The code defends only the reverse direction — a receiver with a roster-established key refuses a relay's differing assertion (`:3131-3134`) — and a plain subscriber is not on the roster, so the owner has nothing to check against. M's own signed key proof (`encodeXMemberConnInfo`, `Internal.hs:2234`) is verified by the relay (`memberJoinRequestViaRelay`, `Subscriber.hs:1684`) and never forwarded. So a relay that substituted a member's key at join could be promoted to owner and then sign rosters and admin messages itself. No in-protocol signature closes this: the substituted key *is* the relay's.

Out-of-band verification closes it and already exists. `APIVerifyGroupMember` (`Commands.hs:2021`) routes channels to `verifyChannelMemberCode`, whose code is `channelMemberCode ownKey memKey` (`Types.hs:1911`) — a hash over *both* member public keys, sorted so each side computes the same value; `setGroupMemberVerified` persists `memberVerifiedCode`. Promotion is gated on it. That is what makes routing `x.grp.promote.*` over relays sound — not the messages, but the key they are built on.

**Any owner can destroy the channel.** `Server.hs:1249` — any recipient key authorises any recipient command, including `DEL` and `LDEL`, with no per-command scoping. Consistent with any-owner-decides; recorded because it is stronger than any chat-level action: the link address is in the published profile, so its loss cannot be repaired by re-publishing.

**RKEY revocation is a race.** `updateKeys` replaces the whole list and has no compare-and-swap, so O1 can evict O2 and vice versa; last writer wins. Additions avoid this via the additive command (§3); removal cannot, which is input to owner removal (§11).

**Chain order is load-bearing.** A reordered or partially-published chain makes link data unreadable to every client and bricks joins. Publish in `owner_auth_index` order and validate locally before `LSET` — the agent rejects a bad chain anyway, but as `CMD PROHIBITED`, not a legible error.

**Creator anonymity is weaker than the overview states.** It claims owners are indistinguishable "provided multiple owners were signed by the root key". Once owner 2 signs owner 3 with its own key the chain shows who delegated to whom, and root-signed entries identify the creator's cohort. Qualify it.

## 9. Tests

Channel tests: `describe "channels"` (`tests/ChatTests/Groups.hs:254`, ~70). `-m "channels"` selects all of them but **not** `chatRelayTests` (`ChatRelays.hs:33`), where the owner-signature suite lives (`:243-380`).

Infrastructure is close: `memberJoinChannel'` already takes `owners :: [TestCC]` and `Groups.hs:9840` passes a 2-element list. Gaps: `promoteChannelMember` (`:8773`) hardcodes one owner and one relay; `prepareChannel*` takes one `owner` and registers relays under its `/relays` (precedent for a second registration at `ChatRelays.hs:351`, why `setupRelay` returns the link); profiles run out at `frank`, so **2 owners + 1 relay + 3 subscribers** is the ceiling; `it` has a 90s timeout (`Utils.hs:94`) that 6 clients plus `threadDelay 1000000` between roster steps will approach.

Patterns: `<###` (`getInAnyOrder`, `Utils.hs:449`) with `EndsWith` where the actor prefix is nondeterministic (unresolved profiles render by member-id hash); `withCCTransaction` SQL for state with no console output (`checkMemberRole`, `Groups.hs:9846`) — the served roster arrives async and silently. `testChannelOwnerKeyAfterLinkUpdate` (`:9545`) is the owner-key template; its `COUNT(1) … member_role = 'owner' AND member_pub_key IS NOT NULL` → `[[1]]` must become `[[2]]`.

Cases: owner 2 promoted, verified by an existing subscriber (TOFU) and a later joiner (link); owner 2 posts as the channel; owner 2's admin message verified by a subscriber that only saw owner 1; owner 2 adds a relay; owner 2 adds owner 3 (chain order); owner 1 offline throughout. §4.1 needs a deterministic race test: two owners, two relays, same version, forced interleaving — both relays and all subscribers converge, loser self-corrects. Adversarial, modelled on `ChatRelays.hs:277-287`: replayed `OwnerAuth`; relay substituting an owner key; replayed `x.grp.promote.acpt`; chain published out of order (must fail closed, and *before* `LSET`); promotion attempted on an unverified key.

**Owner removal.** Not designed. Removing a chain entry invalidates every owner it transitively signed (§4.3); SMP-level revocation is a mutual-eviction race (§8); and there is **no last-owner protection** in the backend — `APIMembersRole` blocks only `selfSelected`, so two owners can already demote each other into an ownerless channel, and RULE-19 is UI-only. The backend guard is worth adding regardless.

**Count-publisher handover.** "The next owner takes over when the first stops writing" needs a rule, but not a good one: getting it wrong means two owners briefly publishing the same relay-sourced number, one rejected. Settle during implementation.

**Disseminating the fingerprint after a write.** An owner could tell the others what the link now hashes to, so the next writer is warm. **Broadcasting the fingerprint alone is unsafe:** it attests *"I merged onto exactly these bytes"*, so an owner adopting one for content it does not hold passes the check while merging onto a stale view — accepted *and* clobbers, worse than the rejection it avoids. Safe forms cost more than they save: broadcasting content verbatim spends ~13.8 KB on every other owner per write whether or not they write next; hashing the plaintext would make a bare-fingerprint broadcast self-verifying but needs byte-exact agreement to ever hit. Not worth it while writes are weekly; revisit if owners alternate often.
